This means employers can\u2019t head onto campuses to meet students like they used to\u2014a traditional primary choice to create authentic connections.<br><br>Now more than ever, employers need a digital-first solution for finding qualified talent, nurturing meaningful relationships, fielding applicants, screening candidates, and hiring their next gen workforce. Even before COVID-19 shuttered campuses, early talent recruiting relied on significant resources: in-person meetings, travel to multiple campuses, and a healthy budget to fund it all.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire practice of traditional recruiting at a small list of core schools is often expensive, outdated, and time-consuming, yielding results that are notoriously difficult to track. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/tag\/customer-stories\/\" target=\"_blank\">The most innovative employers<\/a> have already changed their recruiting model to focus on finding the most qualified talent\u2014no matter where they go to school or who they know\u2014and running a data-driven program with significantly better results.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone else now has to catch up in a hurry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How\u2019s Handshake helping to solve this fall 2020 recruiting challenge?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/talent-acquisition\/pages\/employers-get-creative-hiring-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Thanks to virtual recruiting<\/a>, your efforts are not tied down by time and money. To help you succeed in the digital landscape, Handshake is delivering on a fully end-to-end virtual recruiting experience that eliminates the need for in-person contact. Recruiting remarkable college talent will, perhaps for the first time, have no bounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve always believed that virtual, proactive recruiting is the future for winning top early talent. The advanced targeting and the personalized communication capabilities simply aren&#8217;t possible using traditional methods. And now, COVID-19 is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2020\/04\/30\/your-revised-early-talent-hiring-playbook-for-2020-and-beyond\/#62aae2bea8cf\" target=\"_blank\">persuading businesses to make the shift to virtual<\/a> by necessity and on a much faster timeline. Leading companies already made this shift over the past few years, but many companies are just getting started. Handshake is well-positioned and ready to help get you there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is not a short-term fix for the fall 2020 recruiting season. This is a permanent change to win the mindshare of early talent moving forward. Similar to the shift from on-premise computing to the cloud, early adopters who embrace rapid development, speed, and agility are typically the first to succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those left behind were legacy companies too stubborn to adapt. Winning competition for early talent in the fall 2020 recruiting season and beyond requires a digitally enabled platform like Handshake, so you can focus your efforts on where your talent pools actually are, instead of tapping into the same core schools you\u2019re used to.<br><br>With Handshake, you can maintain the personalization of an on-campus recruiting program, but do it proactively and at scale across the nation, with a lower cost and higher ROI. And with nearly 6 in 10 employers telling us they\u2019re increasing digital engagement, including virtual events, during this time, it\u2019s where the market is headed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does this mean for employers heading into the fall 2020 recruiting season?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fall 2020 recruiting season product release provides the first end-to-end, completely virtual solution for recruiting early talent.
