Despite growing aging workforce trends, 10,000 baby boomers will become eligible for retirement each day over the next ten years,<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;and 80% of older Americans still plan to retire shortly after turning 65.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put these numbers into perspective, of the 164 million people working,&nbsp;<strong>30 million will retire in the next decade<\/strong>. Look around you\u2013that\u2019s 1 in 5 of your current employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have your attention, don\u2019t get left behind. To get a competitive edge, you need to be proactive about building your candidate pipeline early and reiterating often, developing workplace mentoring programs that engage older colleagues with younger ones, and harnessing knowledge to ensure no business intelligence falls through the cracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What steps are you taking to future-proof your organization?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bridging the Aging Talent Gap through Mentoring<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common reasons people leave their jobs is because they aren\u2019t growing in their careers.<sup>4<\/sup>&nbsp;This is especially true of millennials and Gen Z who crave opportunities to develop and refine their skillset, leaving workplace mentoring to be an effective way to engage a diverse, multi-generational workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an AARP survey, 3 in 4 adults say working with older colleagues gives them an opportunity to learn new skills.<sup>3<\/sup>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/advice\/this-company-is-rethinking-mentorshipand-you-should-too\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The benefits of mentoring go both ways.<\/a>&nbsp;Through mentorship, older employees can hone their creativity, tech, and social media skills while younger workers can gain wisdom and insight into navigating the workplace. To learn more, check out how companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/bizwomen\/news\/latest-news\/2019\/02\/mainstream-mentoring-how-companies-spark.html?page=all\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Geographic and Bain &amp; Company<\/a>&nbsp;are leading the way with their impact-driven reverse mentoring programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/careers\/students\/programs\/americas\/new-associate-program.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Associate Program<\/a>, for example, is offered to final year students working toward an advanced degree in 23 of the firm\u2019s offices around the world. Interacting closely with senior business leaders, associates develop product- and function-specific skills through the program while networking with senior professionals who help guide their career. The firm also offers formal mobility through the program and bills its associate roles as a key pipeline for management positions across business areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example is that of construction, mining, and energy equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar, which offers seven professional development programs through various fields for their employees to choose from, alongside 13 employee resource groups (ERGs) for additional mentoring and support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mckinsey.wiggor.pl\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The McKinsey Mentoring<\/a>&nbsp;program is designed to connect prospective employees with people who share career path insights at McKinsey and offer professional guidance, according to the company&#8217;s website. From skills development to advice on working in a changing environment, McKinsey Mentors offer practical strategies for success. Two program recipients&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/careers\/meet-our-people\/careers-blog\/mentorship-ana-and-marina\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shared their experience<\/a>&nbsp;recently.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), schools will reward nearly 4 million college degrees during the 2019-20 academic year alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers ahead of this trend are already looking to early career candidates to help them step into the future.

These employers are screening past legacy requirements, like GPA and hard skills, and instead, are turning to majors and soft skills to get a sense of how a candidate might thrive in their workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also choosing to highlight uniquely personalized employer brands to each of their early career candidate personas, like software developers, and leverage campaigns to proactively build an arsenal of early career candidates to weather talent shortages in the years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For organizations looking to upskill, tapping into this mobile generation is one of the most effective ways to build a diverse talent pipeline for today\u2019s skilled roles, including marketing, software development &amp; engineering, data analytics, and data science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"671\" height=\"213\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Future-Proofing-an-Aging-Workforce_3.png?resize=671%2C213&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Future-Proofing-an-Aging-Workforce_3.png?w=671&amp;ssl=1 671w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Future-Proofing-an-Aging-Workforce_3.png?resize=300%2C95&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Future-Proofing-an-Aging-Workforce_3.png?resize=640%2C203&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>By building your early talent pipeline early and reiterating often and developing robust mentoring programs, you can start bridging the talent gap left by today\u2019s aging workforce.
