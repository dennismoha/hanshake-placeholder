If it was impersonal, probably not. It\u2019s also possible you ignored it. So perhaps it\u2019s not shocking that our data found that students are more likely to respond to messages that feel personalized as well as relevant (i.e. to job roles and industries in which they are interested).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re not personalizing your recruiting message to college students and recent graduates in a meaningful way, candidates are not likely to engage with you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing and recruiting represent two separate business functions, but they share best practices around messaging. According to our Handshake Network Trends report, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/gen-z-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">92% of Gen Z, the \u201calways-connected\u201d generation, prefer connecting with employers by email<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before sending your next recruiting message to a candidate, read through these five effective strategies for personalizing your outreach\u2013plus get seven recruiting message templates to use throughout the candidate lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Download our infographic for <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/resources\/how-to-write-a-recruiting-message\/4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">quick tips to personalize your recruiting messages<\/a>.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Learn about your audience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s early talent is already doing their due diligence by researching you online, on social media, and on Handshake. It\u2019s worth your time to research them, too. Since Handshake is the system of record for more than 1,400 higher education institutions across the country, career centers verify basic information on student profiles, like graduation date. But it\u2019s up to students to build their digital brand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take this opportunity to learn more about their interests, skills, student organization affiliations, etc.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/source\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake Premium employers can use Segments to find students that meet these criteria<\/a>, from filters like coursework and major to student organizations and underrepresented groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create an even more rich profile of your ideal candidate, complement your research with data around what motivates Gen Z. Lean on industry reports and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/resources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other employer resources like how-to guides<\/a> that can help you level up how you engage early talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: say you\u2019re asked to build an early talent pipeline to fill <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/creative-ways-to-make-your-virtual-internship-a-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your virtual summer internship program<\/a>. You want all-star students pursuing business degrees, and while the competition for top early talent remains competitive, you know your employer\u2019s flexible and autonomous&nbsp;culture stands out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this information in mind, find relevant talent that might be interested in what you have to offer by zeroing in on candidates who are looking for part-time work or have demonstrated autonomy through past work experience. Then set yourself apart by leading with those benefits in your outreach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Personalize your recruiting message<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by tailoring the subject line. Students on Handshake will see this in their email inbox, their Handshake inbox, and the push notification they receive from the Handshake App on their smartphone. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/218693318-How-to-Send-a-Student-a-Message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Be sure to mention your company in the subject line\u200a<\/a>\u2014\u200athat\u2019s the basis of our default subject line, which performs well! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you have a less recognizable brand, try inputting the job role for which you are hiring for into the subject line.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin your message with context around who you are and why you\u2019re reaching out. Include what stood out to you about this candidate, how you think they can thrive at your organization, and why your employer is the best place for them to launch their career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Using Segments, Handshake Premium partners can <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/source\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">identify a group of students with specific attributes<\/a> (who might be part of a community service organization, in a leadership position, or know how C++ for example).<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding commonality is another great way to establish rapport. Students are receptive to employers that have hired alumni from their school, location, or major. If you have that information handy, use it in your recruitment message. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re reaching out to a student at one of your partner schools, imagine how much more likely they are to respond if you reference current employees who share their alma mater. In the same vein, if you went to the same school or have another common interest with the candidate, go ahead and make that connection!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your recruiting message should ultimately answer why your company is a great place for that candidate to work, and reference how their interests align with your key value propositions. You can even reference how it felt when you were just starting out in your career, or at your current company. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little empathy for the candidate experience goes a long way for early talent who are just starting out in their careers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Premium partners like <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/resources\/paypal-powers-their-diversity-inclusion-goals-with-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PayPal rely on Campaigns to build better relationships with candidates<\/a> and to personalize messages using variables that automatically populate a student&#8217;s first name, major, and institution name.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Communicate authentically and honestly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/career-centers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Career services centers<\/a> are coaching students to ask about an employer\u2019s culture during their interviews. As they graduate from nearly two decades of schooling and move into their first or second job after college, graduates may have mixed emotions about all the changes ahead. In the same way you\u2019re screening for fit, they are too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">&#8220;Students are invited to study your culture the moment they arrive for an interview. They dissect the language in your outreach\u2014is the message positive and hopeful, or impersonal and terse? Students are even encouraged to look at your email signature for clues on inclusivity, and evaluate when and how calls are scheduled. Essentially every single point of communication provides input into how a student sees the relationship.&#8221;<\/p><cite><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Tiffany Taylor, Strategic Education Success &amp; Training Manager at Handshake<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student demonstrates interest in working at an employer with a fully distributed workforce and that\u2019s something you offer, mention it! Illustrate how \u201cflexible work\u201d is a key tenet for your organization, and how it has helped your colleagues better accommodate their early careers. When you start to consider these components, your hiring narrative shifts quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re using a recruiting message to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/virtual-career-fairs-7-ways-employers-can-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drive attendance at an upcoming virtual career event<\/a>, set students up for success by providing very clear details for how they can prepare for attending. Instructions for video calls, guidance on camera and mic being on\/off in a group session, chat\/Q&amp;A participation instructions, etc., can have lasting impressions on students who are looking for guidance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if emojis are in your personal vocabulary, go ahead and use them in your recruiting message! \ud83d\ude0a  Whatever is unique to you can help you build relationships with students, as well as show that your employer welcomes self-expression.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Close with a call to action<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Always round off your recruiting message with a clear and persuasive call to action (CTA) that directs students to take action. What\u2019s in a CTA? It could direct candidates to RSVP for an upcoming career fair or event, apply to an open job or internship program, or simply learn more about your employer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever it leads, it should be focused\u2014don\u2019t overwhelm your candidates with multiple CTAs\u2014and include a hyperlink. <strong>You might also consider bolding and underlining information you want students to pay special attention to.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your communication with a candidate also shouldn\u2019t dissolve after one message. In fact, your first point of outreach should set the foundation for an ongoing, two-way relationship. Human connection begins the very moment a potential hire learns about your company, and it shouldn\u2019t end there either. Including a personal note at the end of your message like, \u201cI look forward to reviewing your application!\u201d can increase your likelihood of a response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, even with a super clear CTA, keep in mind that most candidates won\u2019t respond to their first email. Don\u2019t get discouraged. According to industry sources, <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2.com\/follow-up-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">messaging the same contact multiple times leads to 2x more responses<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Handshake Premium partners can <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/engage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">schedule follow ups or further personalize messaging based on historical engagement<\/a> so that they never miss a moment to nurture a relationship.&nbsp;<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Review before sending<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s critical to review your recruiting message a few times before hitting send. If you\u2019re messaging a large list, invite a colleague to proofread your message. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/10-ways-to-include-recruit-gen-z-into-your-multi-generational-workforce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gen Z is the most diverse generation yet<\/a>, so when messaging students, it\u2019s important to communicate in a way that celebrates their unique identities while highlighting the value your organization places on diversity, equity, inclusivity, and belonging. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are messaging an underrepresented group, it\u2019s a good idea to ask someone with a shared identity at your organization to review the message and ensure sensitivity. Get started by checking out our blog on the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/8-dos-and-donts-of-messaging-underrepresented-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dos and don\u2019ts of messaging underrepresented students<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actionable emails succeed because they\u2019re hyper-relevant to the receiver. They\u2019re curated by carefully mapping content to the reader\u2019s persona. Does your message address a student directly? Does it sound genuine and personal? Does it have a clear CTA?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360024369273-Messaging-Best-Practices-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keep your recruiting message between 80 and 110 characters<\/a> to get the highest read rate. The content that gets the highest open rate is about jobs!<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Students might get over your company receiving negative coverage in the press, but one surefire way to ensure you never hear from them again is to send a generic, impersonal message. Misplacing your variables, such as your name with theirs, or disclosing inaccurate information can have harmful effects on your reputation and misrepresent your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more a student feels like they\u2019re talking to a real person, the more likely they are to respond and apply to your open roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The bottom line<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re building your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/resources\/mcdonalds-launches-their-early-talent-recruiting-program-with-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">early talent recruiting program from scratch<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/will-early-talent-want-to-work-for-your-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rethinking how you approach your current one<\/a>, continue exploring ways of customizing your messaging. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify opportunities to collect qualitative data about your candidate\u2019s experience, like asking questions about message relevance and engagement in your feedback surveys. Handshake Premium employer partners can review message data, such as open and engagement rates, to reveal trends around language that outperforms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this article focuses on how personalization improves the quality of a recruiting message, it\u2019s important to be thoughtful about message quantity as well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates are receiving messages from many employers at once. If you notice open and engagement rates dipping, that can be a sign that you are sending too many messages, or that the message content isn\u2019t relevant. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving the right balance for your audience may require some experimentation with cadence, frequency, and even seasonality.
