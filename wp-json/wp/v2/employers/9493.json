With a growing number of community colleges on Handshake, recruiting early talent from this pool will connect you with students who represent a mosaic of backgrounds, skills, and languages spoken.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we\u2019ll address some of the many benefits of recruiting early talent from community colleges as an essential component of your equitable hiring strategy, along with tips for maximizing your impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recruiting from community colleges is a critical component of any sustainable DEI strategy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/opportunityamericaonline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Indispensable_Inst_FullReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to Opportunity America<\/a>, a think tank focused on economic mobility, around <strong>one in three community college students are first generation college students<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccdaily.com\/2020\/10\/why-are-community-colleges-doubling-down-on-language-learning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">English language learners are more likely to attend community college than a 4-year institution<\/a>, along with students who are low-income, veterans, and other underrepresented groups. Demographics of 2-year colleges are approximately 50% white and 50% Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian American, and Native American.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recruiting community college students on Handshake is a meaningful action your company can take to bring critical skills and diversity to your workforce.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be conscious of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d.<\/strong> Every school is full of students with skills and capabilities and community colleges are no exception, offering quality, affordable, and accessible education to students of all types of backgrounds. However, community college <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/gender-equity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students have concerns about being perceived as less qualified by employers<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Students who attend a virtual 1:1 and receive a message from an employer are 1.5x more likely to apply<\/strong>, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/handshakes-2020-campus-to-career-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so be proactive about reaching out<\/a>!

These skill-building opportunities can endear a student to your company\u2019s brand and mission, and help them stand out once they\u2019re ready to apply.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Early talent who attend community colleges can offer work experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students who are pursuing non-credit courses, are upskilling at bootcamps, or are enrolled in an associate\u2019s program commonly work part- or full-time throughout their studies. The Center for Community College Engagement\u2019s report on <a href=\"https:\/\/cccse.org\/sites\/default\/files\/WorkingLearner.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Intersection of Work and Learning<\/a> found that <strong>69% of students entering community college also work.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the economy shapeshifting as a result of the pandemic, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90626709\/7-soft-skills-recruiters-value-during-uncertain-and-difficult-hiring-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">soft skills are rising to the top of search criteria<\/a>.

These job opportunities can be life changing, for example, for women returning to work after taking time out to raise kids, veterans who are reskilling, and other underrepresented groups across the age, experience, skills, and demographic spectrum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Write inclusive job descriptions.<\/strong> Use language like \u201cAssociates degrees welcome,\u201d etc. Avoid language like \u201cthose working toward a Bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d or mention of \u201cjuniors and seniors\u201d, which speaks to a 4-year university student audience and can exclude community college students.

But for those who are the first in their families to attend college and\/or conduct a professional job search in the US, you can help expose them to career paths they might not have considered.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, when students think of banking, they may think they need to be good at math when there are so many other types of career paths that can be taken in banking, such as marketing, operations, analytics, etc. <strong>Leveraging alumni Ambassadors from your company<\/strong> is a great way to expose opportunities and engage students in your brand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For harder to fill roles, consider partnering with your local community college<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be challenging for companies located in suburban or rural areas to attract early talent to their location. Partnering with local community colleges is one way to stay competitive and democratize access to your job opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly relevant for more technical roles that require specialized schooling or experience. Community colleges are eager to hear from and partner with employers, and use broader industry insights from your region to create demand-driven curricula.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Perform inclusive candidate searches.<\/strong> Include community colleges and technical schools in your student searches. Use Handshake Premium to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360019970434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">select major groups<\/a>, which have been recently updated to include community college trades like manufacturing, technicians, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Offer paid internships through dedicated funding.<\/strong> Unpaid internships are a privilege that many students can\u2019t afford. Paid internships create a more equitable environment across the board and show your workplace&#8217;s commitment to the wellbeing of your entry-level workers, no matter their background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Participate in workforce planning with community colleges.<\/strong> They are eager to hear from employers to align programs with industry standards. This is a win-win-win for community colleges, students, and employers.&nbsp;Working with community colleges on demand-driven programming creates a strong regional feedback loop to supply local economies with the talent they need to thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Handshake\u2019s 3-sided marketplace can help<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students from underrepresented groups are less likely to benefit from established professional networks, and, despite having some work experience, this is even more so the case for underrepresented groups who are community college students.&nbsp;That\u2019s why Handshake partners with over 500k employers to give these students access to opportunities\u2014<strong>no experience, connections, or luck required.<\/strong> You can, too, by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Developing new school partnerships.<\/strong> Use Handshake to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/why-strong-msi-partnerships-lead-to-a-more-diverse-workforce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build relationships<\/a> with community colleges as one way to diversify your qualified talent pool.<\/li><li><strong>Leaning into digital recruitment.<\/strong> Students can more flexibly attend events, coffee chats, and interviews that are virtual.
