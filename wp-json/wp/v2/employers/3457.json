This ethos trickles down to how we enable leading employers to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/diversity-and-inclusion-7-essential-early-talent-recruiting-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recruit with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion<\/a> (DEI).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers tend to have a lot of discussion with inclusion leaders about how they can leverage digital tools like Handshake to find diverse pockets of qualified students, without ever thinking about how they\u2019re defining the term \u201cqualified\u201d and more importantly why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our world engaging in a movement to ensure minorities, especially Black Americans, are treated with equity, inclusivity, and respect, we went back to the drawing board to attempt to find answers to these questions supported by data.<br><br>As part of that process, we identified a few standard employer practices that are actually disadvantageous to Black students, who are a big target segment for employers looking to fill their recruiting goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We crunched data from our network of more than 6M+ active students across 1K+ partner schools, including 170+ minority-serving institutions like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 150+ diverse student groups like the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what we found:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Our data found that, while nearly 6 in 10 of non-black student applications submitted have a GPA above a 3.5, only 4 in 10 of Black student applications submitted have a GPA above a 3.5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake network data is supported by <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jbhe.com\/2012\/11\/new-data-shows-a-wide-racial-disparity-in-the-gpas-of-college-graduates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">findings from the US Department of Education during the \u201807-\u201908 academic year<\/a>, which confirms that while 75% of white bachelor degree recipients had a GPA of 3.0 or higher, for Black bachelor degree recipients that number was closer to 55%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know the numbers, what are the underlying causes behind this disproportionality? First off, equity isn\u2019t exclusive to GPA. Inaccess to equity permeates across all facets of society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Black-white achievement gap extends from which school districts get more funding on a macro-level, to which students perform better in standardized tests on a personal level. While these disparities have narrowed in recent decades, we\u2019re still a way to go before we can truly democratize access to opportunities.<br><br>Unequal access to key educational resources, including skilled teachers, class size, and quality curriculum, all play an important part. And even if a Black student makes it to dorms on leafy-green campuses, disadvantaged students still live in poverty\u2019s shadow.<br><br>A large portion of jobs posted on Handshake don\u2019t have GPA requirements listed. In reality, candidates offer more to employers than just their GPA, so employers should focus on other qualities like skills, coursework, experience, and extracurriculars to determine qualifications and fit.<br><br>When The Whirlpool Corporation reduced their use of GPA as a proxy for skills and potential, for example, they saw their percentage of underrepresented minority hires increase from 35% to 40% YOY.

This narrative implies that these students, who are more likely to be first generation college students, are prioritizing making a living alongside their coursework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2011 study shows that <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90461708\/why-wealth-equality-remains-out-of-reach-for-black-americans?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">white Americans tend to have more wealth than Black Americans<\/a>\u2014regardless of education level. The study furthers that \u201crather than education leading to wealth, it\u2019s wealth that facilitates the acquisition of an expensive education.\u201d Not to mention the privilege of not having to work multiple jobs to be able to afford that education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same vein, Black students tend to have more on their plates than their peers. This leads us to the assumption that Black students don\u2019t have the same opportunities to iterate on their resumes, cover letters, transcripts, and letters of recommendation within the three week window when applications are typically open during the fall and spring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remarkable employees and qualified candidates shouldn\u2019t be measured based on how many homework assignments they turned in, or whether they are able to complete their applications in time, because often, there are underlying factors to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an always-on talent engine, meaning a strong recruiting presence throughout the year, allows for these students to submit applications when they have the time, space, and most importantly, the means to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

This means that when Black students go to college, they are more likely to not have parents that finished their undergraduate degree or attended a higher education institution at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, this means that folks in their parent\u2019s networks are also less likely to have a college degree, which already leaves them at a disadvantage when it comes to navigating the application process, networking, and relying on resources to help with applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigating the application for your first job is already a challenge for many, so not having that support from the people you hold dear can contribute to the never-ending systemic cycles of oppression Black students tend to face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more information employers can disclose in their job criteria, the more applications they\u2019re likely to receive from Black students. Additionally, simplifying the application process can help, too. To complement our findings around recruiting windows, Black students are more likely to get stuck or not have enough time to perfect the application process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can lead to their inability to submit supplemental content like cover letters, transcripts, work samples, and letters of recommendation because they have more going on in their lives than just the courses they\u2019re working through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supplementary application material may be considered worthwhile for cutting down resume volume and weeding out unqualified candidates when comparing apples to apples, but that\u2019s simply not the case here. We have a very antiquated recruiting process designed to disadvantage and create stumbling blocks for Black talent that have often already had to overcome the hurdles involved in getting to college in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s 2020. Let\u2019s change how we go about the application process and find more meaningful and accessible ways to find top talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Closing thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings confirm the need for employers to help level the systemic inequality gap by leaving behind antiquated measurements that have traditionally defined a candidate\u2019s likelihood for success, like GPA. And to give Black students more time to complete their applications, while providing information that\u2019s critical to their decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low grades already sap the academic self-confidence of Black students. Let\u2019s not add insult to injury here, and make a commitment to look at better measure than GPA to truly assess candidate potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, employers can be proactive in answering Black student\u2019s questions through personal one-on-one messaging, and provide those FAQs for all to see on their Employer Page. Employers should also lean on soft skills assessments to identify growth mindedness, as opposed to test scores and GPAs. Finally, employers can lean on their ambassadors to create more meaningful relationships and identify great additions to the team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that these findings provide you with a good place to start. Together, we can truly carve the path for democratizing opportunities for all students and level the playing field for Black talent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to address systemic challenges by modifying your qualified student search criteria.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034975,"featured_media":3458,"menu_order":0,"template":"","employers_category":[1412],"employers_tag":[1438,1439],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>3 Hiring Practices that Disadvantage Black Students<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Employers, how is your qualified criteria perpetuating systemic barriers to Black students finding a great first job?
