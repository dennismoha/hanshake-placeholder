We\u2019re fortunate enough to be a URx partner and were excited to come back to the big URx conference after a series of regional meetups throughout the US in Anaheim, Dallas, New York and Chicago before the conference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s great to see this community of early talent and university recruiting professionals pick up so much momentum over the last couple years. Handshake is determined to continue these conversations and elevate you\u2014our employer partners\u2014as much as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An experiential approach to early talent recruiting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Day 1 of URx, Handshake CEO and co-founder Garrett Lord sat down with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/coreytwitty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Corey Twitty<\/a>, Talent Acquisition Manager of University Recruiting, to discuss the merits of bringing experiential elements into campus recruiting. Their fireside chat covered a wide variety of topics, from the efficacy of experiential recruiting, to diversity &amp; inclusion, to optimizing your recruiting organization to hire faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To kick off the conversation, the two discussed the importance of combining your on-campus strategy with a digital approach. Corey explained his methodology of bringing these two distinct tactics together by starting with the data. He found that there was a lack of ROI coming from certain types of events and saw more quality hires from other channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhen we step back and look at all the types of events we go to and pull up the ROI, we weren\u2019t getting a high ROI from career fairs, that digital relationship and marrying that with the physical was very profound for us.\u201d<\/p><cite>\u2014Corey Twitty, Talent Acquisition Manager of University Recruiting at Intuit<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean the campus event is dead\u2014it\u2019s all about how you set it up and approach it. According to Corey, you not only need to make memorable experiences, but you should also consider building meaningful relationships with students before showing up to campus. \u201cUniversity recruiting will always be somewhat event-based,\u201d Corey opined. \u201cAs you think about how you maximize ROI &amp; engagement, how do you create events &amp; experiences that are memorable and provide an emotional connection?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to early talent recruiting tactics\u2014both on campus and online\u2014Corey has seen it all. He\u2019s spent the last ten years finding and hiring top talent that is just starting out in their careers. To resonate with this particular audience, he swears by experiential recruiting events, which focus on holding workshops for early talent at different campuses and seeing how they think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Making a case for early talent hiring<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all know, these on-campus events and digital strategies come at a cost. Half the battle is getting adequate funding to back these high-ROI initiatives. When Garrett asked Corey about getting buy-in on his projects, Corey replied with a pragmatic, clear response: \u201cYou really have to leverage data to build the business case. Where are you getting the most ROI? That helps persuade your business partners.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change what you can\u2019t measure. How do you move the needle from last year?\u201d<\/p><cite>\u2014Corey Twitty, Talent Acquisition Manager of University Recruiting at Intuit<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Corey mentioned that he ensures his business partners are looped in at every stage of the process. He thought back to a time when his data-driven approach brought some great results when he recounted, \u201cOur Head of Sales was so happy with our university talent that he told us last week that we need to hire 10 more new hire grads for July. We went right to Handshake, and we sourced with Segments and Campaigns to reach students.\u201d He mentioned that within a week of that moment, they had already brought four people on site to interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Leveling the playing field for all early talent<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>When Garrett asked Corey about his approach to diversity &amp; inclusion, Corey firmly stated, \u201cDiversity is not a choice. It\u2019s critical for all of us to have a team that looks and thinks like our customers. If we preach customer empathy and we don\u2019t have team members that haven\u2019t walked in their shoes, that\u2019s a miss.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corey mentioned a time where his employer had a goal to balance gender and have a much more representative workforce. He remembered his team worrying about meeting the expectations around those initiatives as they built out a 3-year plan. By taking a more proactive approach to their early talent strategy with digital solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Handshake Premium<\/a>, Corey mentioned that his team was able to nearly hit their goal in just one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Continue the conversation<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>That was just one of the many compelling talks during the URx 2019 Conference. There were discussions about employer brand, building talent pipelines through (winter) internships, and leveraging analytics to scale.
