To score big at the ETAs, Liberty Mutual harnessed Handshake to build relationships at scale and create thoughtful event content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key takeaway from Liberty Mutual: <strong>introducing students to your brand early on in their college journeys leads to more engagement over time.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/engage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake Event Manager<\/a> to create an infinite number of branded virtual events and experiences for underclassmen in addition to upperclassmen.&nbsp;<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Liberty Mutual&#8217;s tips for engaging early talent this fall:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Create a cohesive candidate journey across your brand. Dress in the color scheme of your brand, use those colors in the background of your video calls, etc.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Offer a variety of event types, like:<br><ul><li>Skill-building experiences (i.e. public speaking)<\/li><li>Topics Gen Z cares about (i.e. DEI and mental health)<\/li><li>Tactical support (i.e. building out <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/step-up-your-profile-summer-challenge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students\u2019 Handshake profiles<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Whether a student attends a virtual career event or not, a connection was made with your company. <\/strong>Event registration provides a touchpoint for you to follow-up on and build a relationship with that student.<\/li><li>Supplement all experiences with before, during, and after event outreach<em>. <\/em>Communicate at regular intervals (i.e. monthly) via multiple touchpoints (i.e. virtual event invites, 1:1 messages, newsletters) and timely content.<\/li><li>Recruiters are at the forefront of virtual recruiting innovation.

Putting yourself in their shoes, consider if a session that\u2019s traditionally been 1 hour can actually be 30 minutes.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gap Inc. Solicits Feedback on the Candidate Experience to Improve Events<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having to adapt to virtual recruiting was a game changer for Gap Inc.\u2019s early talent strategy. By scaling up virtual strategies, Gap found that business needs can be met with a more diverse set of schools. They rely on Handshake to tap into students with different backgrounds and new schools that hadn\u2019t previously been on their radar.&nbsp;Now, Gap executes on a strategy to meet students where they are, and how they want to be engaged with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Gap Inc. saw strong engagement with smaller format events, and by doing follow up sessions after large format events.&nbsp;<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gap Inc.\u2019s tips for engaging early talent this fall:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Seek out feedback on the candidate experience to uncover blind spots. (Put bluntly, you want to know if students find a session boring!) Gap collected virtual event feedback from students and found that some of their standard events were too long and too one way.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Gap developed topical event series, such as \u201cSeveral Seats at the Table\u201d, to address the company\u2019s commitment to inclusion and share info about employee belonging groups. After events like these, they follow up with virtual 1:1 information sessions to evaluate qualified candidates for open positions. <strong>Relationship-building requires follow up, so don\u2019t skip that step!<\/strong><\/li><li>Career fairs are often limited to one day and time. Now, Gap Inc. creates bite-sized info sessions and posts these on YouTube, creates at-a-glance one pagers, and customizes messages with student\u2019s names, school, and major at scale.<\/li><li>Target freshmen and sophomores with learning experiences over the course of an event series to expose them early to functional tracks, professional development, and internship opportunities.<\/li><li>Gap Inc. worked with their Handshake expert account team to specify Segments to target the talent they were looking for.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h6>With Handshake Premium you can <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/keeping-your-employer-brand-relevant-in-times-of-transition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create a digital employer brand<\/a> that speaks to Gen Z, offer experiences that allow for additional learning about your company, and dramatically expand access to students.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prudential Incorporates Personalization and Employee Engagement into Every Program<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual recruiting acted as a catalyst for Prudential in building a more inclusive and expansive sourcing strategy. The pandemic was an ah-ha moment that led Prudential to revisit why they only recruited from certain schools, so they turned to Handshake to diversify their schools strategy and innovate how they expressed their brand to early talent digitally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/source\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake\u2019s School Explorer<\/a> to plan which schools to develop close relationships with and build relationships with candidates you want through Campaigns at scale.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prudential\u2019s tips for engaging early talent this fall:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>To really level the playing field, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/3-hiring-practices-that-disadvantage-black-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>re-examine your qualifications<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Look into candidates who have different majors, double down on coursework or skills, and include candidates who are pursuing their associates degree or are in bootcamps.&nbsp;<\/li><li>In the fall recruiting season, offer events that set students up for success such as resume workshops. During the spring and summer, lean into brand building and diversity-focused events.&nbsp;<\/li><li>In the past, Prudential didn\u2019t cap event attendance and went for a quantity goal. In shifting to virtual, they used a very practical consideration to guide their event attendance goals: <strong>on a Zoom call, you can only see up to 25 faces<\/strong> <strong>at once<\/strong>!&nbsp;<\/li><li>Let students choose how they want to engage with you. Something as simple as changing the time that you host events can make a big impact on event attendance. For increased accessibility, record all of your events and add them to your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/products\/premium\/?slide=brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake Employer Page<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Prudential taps employees to share their personal stories about how they\u2019re navigating their careers. Partner with business resource groups to build authentic programming and foster relationships between students and employees who look like them. <strong>Part of the relationship-building process is encouraging employees to stay in touch with the candidate<\/strong> and turning off the corporate speak!&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kiewit Diversifies Their School Strategy to Attract Target Groups<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiewit\u2019s perspective is that 2020 was the best case scenario for forward-thinking strategies: they can now do more, more efficiently, and more cost effectively by engaging candidates virtually. This fall, the opportunity to conduct hybrid recruiting will incorporate lessons learned while formalizing the wins that resulted from the past year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key takeaway: <strong>identify an executive sponsor for your early talent program to back you up on its efficacy and help disseminate impact.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kiewit\u2019s tips for engaging early talent this fall:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Kiewit set out to establish accountability from the top down to develop talent within their ranks by using Handshake to build an early talent pipeline that can ultimately diversify its workforce at every level.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You may need to educate the business that when recruiting was primarily in person, your team didn\u2019t find all talent at in-person career fairs in the first place! <strong>Sourcing digitally doesn\u2019t diminish the value of those in-person touchpoints, but it does mean that your precious resources can be freed up from days on the road to accomplish the same work in an afternoon spent on Handshake.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li>Perform a top-of-funnel assessment of what\u2019s important to the candidates you\u2019re trying to attract. Women comprise only 10% of the construction workforce, and Kiewit embraced that they needed to engage women differently to recruit them. Making sure a female operational leader was present at career fairs may sound like a no brainer, but Kiewit admits they overlooked this in the past.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The \u201cFuture Women with Kiewit\u201d seminar held every semester, is an example of targeted event content that is best practice for engaging a specific audience.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Consider adopting a program like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kiewit.com\/pages\/university-relations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kiewit\u2019s Faculty Scholars<\/a>, where a college professor interns at Kiewit to take that experience back to the classroom and facilitate knowledge sharing to their students.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h6>You might find that your company has maintained allegiances to certain schools, but breaking perceptions into a school-agnostic approach and vocalizing your strategy with upper management can dramatically tilt the balance of your early talent recruit strategy toward equity.

What sets this ETA winner apart is how UnitedHealth Group incorporates their company\u2019s values throughout materials and experiences to tell a cohesive story.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key takeaway: <strong>utilize video as a humanized way for current employees to share their stories with candidates and build relationships.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UnitedHealth Group&#8217;s tips for engaging early talent this fall:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Approach candidate engagement through multi-channel marketing. Your Handshake Employer Page, careers page, and social presence are all sources of truth for Gen Z to get a sense of culture, alignment with interests, and belonging.<\/li><li>Video is a brand-building medium that candidates can access on their own time.
