But these digital natives are comfortable relying on virtual mediums to build their professional network\u2014and are already seeing the benefits in doing so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to our Handshake Network Trends report, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/gen-z-relationships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">8 in 10 Gen Z job-seekers believe that digital connections sparked by messages will lead to a job opportunity<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for employers looking to build more meaningful relationships with students, the challenge with virtual career events is that they leave little room for informal conversations. That\u2019s why this fall, we made major investments into tools that make it easier to create employer-student relationships. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these new features for employers on Handshake. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Connect with students one on one with Virtual Info Chats<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-12.57.45-PM.png?resize=554%2C414&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Connect with students one on one with virtual info chats\" class=\"wp-image-10789\" width=\"554\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-12.57.45-PM.png?resize=1024%2C766&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-12.57.45-PM.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-12.57.45-PM.png?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-12.57.45-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Students will see the option to message you or book a 15-minute time slot with you if you choose to be contacted.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to recent Handshake usage data, candidates who engage with employers one on one are 36% more likely to apply to a job. To make it easier for employers to connect with early talent at scale, we recently launched Virtual Info Chats on Handshake to facilitate those first connections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Virtual Info Chats<\/strong> are 15-minute video sessions that you can host directly within Handshake to proactively build relationships with interested students, get them excited about your company and jobs, and raise awareness of your employer brand to improve application conversions.
