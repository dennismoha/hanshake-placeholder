In this blog, we&#8217;re featuring a student&#8217;s perspective, written by that student herself.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working as an intern at Handshake means that I&#8217;m often asked to fill in the gaps about things that a &#8220;young person&#8221; would know. Like what someone my age would find engaging in content, what features have that desired aesthetic, and what the common struggles of trying to find a job are. Sometimes I have the answers and other times I don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m qualified to speak for everyone under the age of 25 at all times\u2014Gen Z.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I can do is provide insight based on my observations in my role as a marketing content intern. Every work day I&#8217;m interviewing students from all over the country who have different majors, backgrounds, passions, and things that they want out of their career. In their complexities I&#8217;ve come to observe the little nuances that motivate us as a generation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As graduation began to creep up on me last year and adulthood beckoned, I began to dream of a job that would allow me to leave a unique impact on the world while also ensuring that I\u2019d be able to exist without constant terror of my future financials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be just another person behind a computer or a social media poltergeist. I wanted to do relevant, meaningful work that would make a difference\u2014no matter how clich\u00e9 that phrasing might sound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My generation is called Gen Z, those born at the tail end of the millennial spell with the eldest of us on the precipice of our mid-20s.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve most likely seen older Zs around your workspaces\u2014the interns and new hires, born during the early stages of the internet and raised on the upswing of social media. Maybe we\u2019re driving your rideshares to work or maybe we&#8217;re your morning barista heroes. We are future business owners, doctors, engineers, and writers, and according to the Department of Labor, Gen Z will make up <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/foundation\/ourwork\/initiatives\/preparing-for-future-hr-trends\/Documents\/10-15%20Randstad%20Presentation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">36% of the global workforce<\/a> by next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with this new wave entering the job market, new desires and ideal workplace standards will follow. Here are the four things Gen Z job-seekers are looking for\u2014besides a living wage and cold brew on tap\u2013in their own words:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Guide Young Careers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-left\"><p>\u201cI would find a mentor. The people make the job easier to come to and also makes you passionate about it.\u201d <\/p><cite>\u2014Taylor Wong, University of San Diego<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re wave-makers and we want to prove our worth, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want someone more experienced in the industry to show us the ropes and provide meaningful insights. Growth is a huge part of launching our careers and without the collaboration of others there would be less room for a holistic look at our industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where Gen Zs Want to Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cDefinitely the area I like to stay in. I came to New York [for school], but the New England area\u2014I definitely don\u2019t want to travel too far away from that.\u201d<\/p><cite>\u2014Eva Barinelli, Worcester Polytechnic Institute<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many are tailoring their search for jobs to specific cities where they want to work after graduation. No matter how big or small the city, the location of the job holds relevance in the search for that dream job. Whether we picture ourselves around home, loved ones or the next big thing, sites like Handshake make it easy for students and alumni alike to focus on one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Communication is so Empowering<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI definitely would look for a place that is very communicative with their employees. Very much open to feedback.\u201d<\/p><cite>\u2014Olivia Prescott, St. Olaf College<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a voice it can feel wholly empowering. Even more so, when input that you&#8217;ve been pushing for is actually acted upon, an incredible environment of collaboration can come to fruition for both individual employees and the organization as a whole. Complacency in the workplace has the opposite effect, especially for individualistic and opinionated Gen Z.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Stay Relevant to Young Talent<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>\u201cI look for good company culture, so I can meet a few different things. I like smaller offices so you have more hands on work, and you can directly interact with your boss and supervisors. There&#8217;s a lot of interaction with like clients and other individuals.\u201d<\/p><cite>\u2014Christina Plakas, Hamilton College<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As the most racially and ethnically diverse generation yet, we want our workspaces to reflect the world that we live in. If we grind and devote ourselves to a company that outwardly champions causes of social relevance, there\u2019s an expectation that they follow through on that mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not the company that makes the people, it&#8217;s the people that make the company. <br><br>Attracting young talent because you embody an authentic, honest culture is a positive sign that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/will-early-talent-want-to-work-for-your-company\/\">your workplace is headed in the right direction<\/a>. The future is going to be filled with us leading, learning, collaborating, and providing solutions together. As an extension of ourselves, we desire a space to grow and thrive our careers in.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gen Z has entered the chat.
