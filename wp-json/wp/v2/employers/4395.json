But what about the college achievement gap?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to school, the main challenge for Latinx students comes with balancing providing financial assistance for their families with the importance those families place on attaining a postsecondary college degree, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2016\/07\/28\/5-facts-about-latinos-and-education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to Pew Research Center<\/a>.

This can lead to an inability to submit supplemental application material like cover letters, transcripts, work samples, and recommendation letters because they have more going on in their lives than just coursework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional documentation may be considered worthwhile for cutting down resume volume and weeding out unqualified candidates when comparing apples to apples, but that\u2019s simply not the case here. We have an antiquated recruiting system designed to create stumbling blocks for underrepresented groups that have already had to overcome the hurdles associated with getting to college.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line is, the more information employers can disclose in their job criteria, the more applications they\u2019re likely to receive from Latinx students and other underrepresented groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>When one of the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies, Amgen, expanded their qualified search criteria beyond GPA, broadened their school network, and personalized their recruitment model, they were able to <strong>increase applicants from Latinx candidates by 4.5x<\/strong> from 2017 to 2019.
