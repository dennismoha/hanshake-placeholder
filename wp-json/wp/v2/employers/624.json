As inclusive language evolves, our empathy, vocabulary and specific word choice should shift in tandem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Handshake, we believe students are more than a GPA and major and want to help every student bring their full-self to the career search.&nbsp;<strong>Over 70% of students shared with us that they prefer a company that is diverse, inclusive, and makes them feel included regardless of race, geographic location, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status, and appearance.<\/strong>&nbsp;As recruiters prepare for campus visits, each interaction should reflect a student\u2019s or group\u2019s style and preference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help, Handshake\u2019s Employee Resource Groups identified language principles that would ensures all students are treated with respect and dignity. The list of terms includes concepts to know, expressions to avoid, and words to incorporate into your vocabulary, job descriptions, and conversations with students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessing phrases and words that usually go unchallenged, and changing personal habits requires patience and empathy. Some of these words are harmless and meant to be educational. Others are hurtful; usually said unintentionally without knowledge of their history or implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>This guide will provide you with:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Principles to remember:<\/strong>&nbsp;Every language is built off of rules and frameworks.

Inclusive language is structured similarly. These principles help you enter conversations mindful of an individual\u2019s or audience\u2019s preferences.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Put people first:<\/strong>&nbsp;It is essential to put the person first\u200a\u2014\u200ato focus on the person, not their characteristics, e.g., instead of \u201ca blind woman\u201d or \u201ca woman salesperson,\u201d use \u201ca woman who is blind\u201d or \u201ca woman on our sales team.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are more than our descriptors<\/strong>, so putting people first keeps the individual as the essential element. Only mention characteristics like gender, sexual orientation, religion, racial group or ability when relevant to the discussion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use universal phrases:<\/strong>&nbsp;Idioms<strong>,<\/strong>&nbsp;industry jargon and acronyms can exclude a student who may not have specialized knowledge of a particular subject and impede effective communication as a result. Many idioms don\u2019t translate well from country to country. For example, saying \u201cHit it out of the park\u201d could potentially turn your encouragement into a source of embarrassment if the person fails to grasp the expression or baseball\u2019s cultural impact and significance. Instead say, \u201cI believe in you!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recognize the impact of mental health language:<\/strong>&nbsp;\u201cBipolar,\u201d \u201cPTSD,\u201d \u201cOCD\u201d and \u201cADD\u201d are real mental health diagnoses that people possess. Using these terms to describe everyday behaviors underplays the impact of someone\u2019s experiences with a mental disorder. Also, avoid derogatory terms that stem from the context of mental health, like \u201cschizo,\u201d \u201cparanoid,\u201d or \u201cpsycho.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use gender neutral language.<\/strong>&nbsp;Using \u201cguys\u201d to address all people is gendered languages that may insinuate that men are the preferred gender at your organization. Instead, work in inclusive words such as; folks, people, you all, y\u2019all, and teammates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growth mindset:<\/strong>&nbsp;Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). When entire companies embrace a growth mindset,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/01\/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">their employees report feeling far more empowered and committed.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask if you aren\u2019t sure:<\/strong>&nbsp;Inclusive language is nuanced and used to reflect an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s personal style and preference. If you\u2019re not sure, ask your colleagues and students how they talk about themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Phrases to&nbsp;avoid<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The list of phrases contains two types of expressions: gendered or exclusive terms that will decrease the likelihood of attracting a targeted candidate profile; and everyday phrases with racist origins.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bossy:<\/strong>&nbsp;This term has been skewed to be a negative term to describe a woman that is direct and communicates expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guys:<\/strong>&nbsp;Using \u201cguys\u201d to address all people is gendered languages that may insinuate that men are the preferred gender at your organization. Instead, use gender-neutral language such as; folks, people, you all, y\u2019all, and teammates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Girl\/Girls:<\/strong>&nbsp;For anyone over 18 years old, woman or women is a better choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grandfathering\/grandfather clause:<\/strong>&nbsp;A way to exempt some people from a change because of conditions that existed before the change (e.g. we\u2019ve grandfathered some users on an unlimited data plan.\u201d) The term \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d originated in the American South in the 1890s as a way to defy the 15th Amendment and prevent black Americans from voting.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term is \u201cprobably an abbreviation of \u2018gypsy,\u2019 a word commonly used to describe the Romani people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ghetto:<\/strong>&nbsp;According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word was first used in 1611 to describe a quarter in a city, chiefly in Italy, to which the Jews were restricted under the Nazi regime during WWII. In America, the term became associated with poor areas with non-white residents. Now, it\u2019s a bigoted term that gets tossed around to mean low-class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Females:<\/strong>&nbsp;To many English speakers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/article\/He-Keeps-Calling-Us\/239595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cfemales\u201d sounds like a scientific designation<\/a>&nbsp;one would use for animals or plants.

Alternatives: engineer, developer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Handicap:<\/strong>&nbsp;Some disability advocates believe this term is rooted in a correlation between a disabled individual and a beggar, \u201cwho had to beg with a cap in his or her hand because of the inability to maintain employment.\u201d Better alternative: Disabled<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Housekeeping:<\/strong>&nbsp;In reference to office work, this language can feel gendered.

It implies that these nations are only defined by how they were perceived by Europeans after 1492, when their people were massacred.

Try women instead, or \u201cfolks\u201d or \u201cpeople\u201d for mixed-gender groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lame:<\/strong>&nbsp;Originally used in reference to people with reduced mobility, now often a synonym for \u201cuncool.\u201d Both types of uses are ableist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Man:<\/strong>&nbsp;As a synonym for work\u200a\u2014\u200aas in \u201cman hours,\u201d \u201cman the inbox,\u201d \u201cman the conference booth,\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athis is unnecessarily gendered language. Try using work instead. More inclusive: Folks, people, you all, y\u2019all, teammates<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Master\/slave:<\/strong>&nbsp;Problematic term sometimes used to refer to one machine that has the original copy of data and others that automatically update themselves to match its data. Replacements include&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/django\/django\/pull\/2692\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">primary\/replica<\/a>, primary\/standby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mental Disability:<\/strong>&nbsp;The use of this phrase implies that someone that may struggle or have a psychiatric diagnosis is disabled and unable to do their job. This is likely to make them feel stigmatized and unwelcome in the workplace. Many people that struggle with mental health problems are great at their jobs, despite adversity, and supporting them can make them an even greater asset to your workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meritocracy:<\/strong>&nbsp;Belief in the flawed idea that hard work and talent alone are all that\u2019s needed to achieve success. Challenges like implicit bias, structural inequality and varying degrees of privilege or disadvantage mean&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2013\/11\/silicon-valley-isnt-a-meritocracy-and-the-cult-of-the-entrepreneur-holds-people-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">meritocracy isn\u2019t currently a reality<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minority:<\/strong>&nbsp;The word is sometimes used as a blanket term for people from underrepresented groups including African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and so on. People of color will comprise a majority of the nation\u2019s population in a little more than a generation by 2040.

It also assumes that people with disabilities are inferior to the non-disabled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility:<\/strong>&nbsp;The practice of designing and developing interview processes, creating resources and writing job descriptions that provide a great experience for students from diverse backgrounds, i.e., students who are first-generation or with disabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ageism:<\/strong>&nbsp;A system of beliefs, attitudes, and actions that stereotype and discriminate against individuals or groups on the basis of their age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alaska Native:&nbsp;<\/strong>someone that is of indigenous heritage to Alaska, this includes the Aleut, Athabascan, Alutiiq, Cup\u2019ik, Haida, Inuit, I\u00f1upiat, Tlingit and Yup\u2019ik people. The term \u201cEskimo\u201d is widely perceived as derogatory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ally:<\/strong>&nbsp;Someone who supports a group other than their own (in terms of racial identity, gender, faith identity, sexual orientation, etc.). Allies acknowledge disadvantage and oppression of other groups; take risks and act on the behalf of others, and invest in strengthening their own knowledge and awareness of oppression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Affinity groups:<\/strong>&nbsp;A group of people who choose to meet to explore a shared identity such as race, gender, age, religion, and sexual orientation. These groups can be further broken down into smaller groups within the two major affinities (i.e. White men, White women, African American men\/women, bi\/multi-racial, etc.). At work these are sometimes called Employee Resource Groups, or ERGs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amplification:<\/strong>\u00a0A technique an ally can use to boost the message of a member of a less dominant group by repeating what that person said and giving them credit for it. For example,\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/taking-note\/how-to-be-an-ally-in-the-office-4d49535370c8\">Natalie says, \u201cwhen you hear another coworker making a derogatory comment about or a joke at the expense of LGBTQ people, voice your concern about the impact of such comments on your company culture, emphasizing that there\u2019s nothing negative about being LGBTQ.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cisgender<\/strong>: Individuals whose gender identity and expression line up with their birth-assigned sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Code-switching:<\/strong>&nbsp;The practice of mixing various languages and speech patterns in conversation \u2013or more broadly,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/codeswitch\/2013\/04\/08\/176064688\/how-code-switching-explains-the-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">changing the way you express yourself<\/a>&nbsp;culturally and linguistically based on different parts of your identity and how they are represented in the group you\u2019re with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Culture fit:&nbsp;<\/strong>The likelihood that a job candidate will be able to conform and adapt to the core values and collective behaviors that make up an organization.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/larsschmidt\/2017\/03\/21\/the-end-of-culture-fit\/#3cf61c27638a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">As companies discover that looking for a \u201cculture fit\u201d does not promote inclusion<\/a>, the term is being replaced with \u201cculture adds\u201d; values-aligned individuals who want to have an impact and contribute positively to the culture you\u2019re building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diverse<\/strong>: Individuals cannot be diverse. Groups of individuals can be diverse, however, when referring to candidates, refrain from saying \u201cdiverse talent\u201d or \u201cdiverse candidate.\u201d Instead, try underrepresented talent or individuals, or HUGs (historically underrepresented groups). The use of this term also depends on where you stand. For example, underrepresented groups only look \u201cdiverse\u201d to the overrepresented. So by using the term \u201cdiverse,\u201d you accept the frame of reference of the majority.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diversity:<\/strong>&nbsp;Individual differences that include (but not limited to) ability, learning styles, life experiences, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, political, and religion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dominant culture:<\/strong>&nbsp;The cultural beliefs, values, and traditions that are centered and dominant in society\u2019s structures and practices. Dominant cultural practices are thought of as \u201cnormal\u201d and, therefore, preferred and right. As a result, diverse ways of life are often devalued, marginalized, and associated with low cultural capital. Conversely, in a multicultural society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equity:&nbsp;<\/strong>Equity aims at making sure that everyone\u2019s lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. Social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equality:<\/strong>\u00a0Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gender identity:<\/strong>&nbsp;A person\u2019s perception of their gender, which may or may not correspond with their birth sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1035\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?fit=1024%2C662&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-755\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?resize=768%2C497&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?resize=1024%2C662&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?resize=640%2C414&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/0_-KYtpDrkVsnOo4V7.png?resize=1200%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption>Photo Credit:\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ItsPronouncedMetrosexual.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sites.ed.gov\/whhbcu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>HBCU<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong>&nbsp;An acronym that stands for \u201chistorically black colleges and universities.\u201d These are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established with the intention of primarily serving the black community, though they have always allowed admission to students of all races.
