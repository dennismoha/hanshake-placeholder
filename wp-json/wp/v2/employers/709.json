Students are researching opportunities continuously throughout the year, and expect a constant stream of information and interaction. It\u2019s time to revisit your recruiting routines and invest in your digital engagement strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/hs.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/premium?utm_campaign=Employer%20-%20TES%20Launch%202018&amp;utm_source=medium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Talent Engagement Suite<\/strong><\/a>, your team can start effectively engaging Handshake\u2019s network of more than 9 million students and young alumni across 600 universities in the U.S. The Suite is built on a trusted platform your team already uses \u2014 no new systems, no lengthy implementation \u2014 and removes the \u2018busy work\u2019 for your team that many tools require.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our lead product manager on the Talent Engagement Suite,&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/molly-johnson-5449526a\/\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Johnson<\/a>, describes the offering:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really about engaging students proactively and building your brand intentionally versus just sitting back and waiting to see who comes into your pipeline.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"21aa\">The 5 Dimensions of Better Student Engagement<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s possible now to engage at every stage of a student\u2019s career journey. With Handshake\u2019s new Talent Engagement Suite, you can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Proactively drive students to your Jobs and Events with&nbsp;<strong>smart campaigns and segmentation.&nbsp;<\/strong>Define your hiring criteria \u2014 let\u2019s say, STEM students who have had internships as Data Analysts \u2014 as Segments in the system, then reach the most qualified students at the right time. Scheduled Campaigns allow you to plan ahead, setting up outreach before the busy times of campus visits and interviews. Imagine arriving at a Career Fair knowing that the most ideal candidates at that college received a pre-scheduled, personalized message 24 hours earlier, while you were traveling! Or that students you meet at the booth will receive a quality follow-up automatically that evening, while you\u2019re catching up on work emails at the hotel?<\/li><li>Connect with students in a meaningful way through&nbsp;<strong>in-person and virtual events, plus Event Check-In<\/strong>. By centralizing all event activity on Handshake, you can maximize those existing campus investments by inviting the right students, downloading RSVP lists, accepting check-ins at a booth or info session, and following up right from Handshake. Virtual Events allow you to reach top talent across the nation, expanding your reach in addition to your physical campus visits.<\/li><li>Highlight your authentic story with&nbsp;<strong>content and branding<\/strong>&nbsp;throughout the platform. Handshake allows you to personalize the content on you Employer Page and every job post, based on the student\u2019s major. This can drive better engagement within segments you\u2019ve historically struggled \u2014 for example, traditional employers starting to recruit software engineers.<\/li><li>Build student&nbsp;<strong>relationships at scale<\/strong>. With the Candidate Journey functionality, you can understand candidates\u2019 touch points with your company and use that rich context to guide the recruiting conversation. For example: you\u2019ll know if a student has attended your events, when you send a personal message through Handshake.<\/li><li>Become a data-driven recruiting team with&nbsp;<strong>proprietary analytics<\/strong>&nbsp;from the Handshake platform<strong>.&nbsp;<\/strong>Understand the effectiveness of proactive outreach with in-product Campaign results. Dive into custom reporting and market benchmarks with your dedicated Handshake resource.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"f046\">Early Results from Leading Employers<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Several of our most

Recruiting Director, M&amp;T Bank<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cI think almost all UR teams are understaffed and with the amount of inbound you get from active

former member of IBM\u2019s University team<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IBM\u2019s virtual event through Handshake\u2019s Talent Engagement Suite at NSBE was a huge success, directly helping them broaden their reach particularly with historically underrepresented students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Students from 200+ universities across the country joined the livestream<\/li><li>Over 60% of attendees were part of
