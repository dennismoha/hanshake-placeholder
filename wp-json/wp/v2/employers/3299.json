Get a Head Start on the New Normal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As <strong>Christie Dougherty<\/strong>, University Outreach Specialist at <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/sas-on-campus-hiring-top-university-talent-with-handshake\/\">S<\/a><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/sas-on-campus-hiring-top-university-talent-with-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/sas-on-campus-hiring-top-university-talent-with-handshake\/\">S<\/a> suggested, \u201cWhat is \u2018normal\u2019 now won\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in the future,\u201d and many employers alike are getting ahead of the inevitable and preparing early for what is expected to be a virtual fall and spring recruiting season. Many are doing so by connecting with their career services partners early and utilizing <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360023878153-Handshake-s-Premium-Employer-Offering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake Premium features such as Segments and Campaigns<\/a> to proactively connect with priority candidates in lieu of face to face meetings. By focusing on these relationships in creative ways, employers can drive more impactful employee engagement early on and discover what works and what doesn\u2019t work come fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Ensure Technology Equity Early<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a part of the process to prepare remote interns for onboarding at Intuit and SAS, program managers ensure that all interns have adequate WiFi, access to a computer, a quiet place to work, and housing for the summer before kicking off their virtual internship. Access can create an equity issue, and many employers are not only aware, but working proactively to handle such issues on a case-by-case basis. <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/report-how-covid-19-is-impacting-college-recruiting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The shift to virtual has opened up opportunities for employers<\/a> like Intuit to offer stipends to new hires with the funds that were previously allocated for employee travel and relocation expenses, bringing their entire HR operations to the virtual sphere (and not just recruiting).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Utilize Virtual Ambassadors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside Handshake\u2019s upgraded <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360044367074-Handshake-s-Guide-to-Virtual-Ambassadors?_ga=2.56868072.359989951.1594160380-1106855218.1592331844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ambassador Campaigns feature<\/a>, Handshake Premium partners are utilizing elements of personalization within the app to get in front of qualified students. Leveraging current employees as \u201cambassadors\u201d for prospective hires allows for them to get a better idea of whether or not that company is right for them from someone they can relate to. That can then lead to future conversations with other members of the team, ultimately making communication and transparency within the organization more available and direct. <strong>Fred Davis<\/strong>, Talent Acquisition Manager at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), noted engaging with students strategically to give them insight into the company as being a key factor to their recruiting success thus far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Lean into Personal and Professional Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now more than ever, great candidates want to hear and learn from employees who are like them. Pivoting virtually has increased the need for senior employees and company ambassadors to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/how-to-write-a-recruiting-message-to-students-plus-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interact with prospective hires and form meaningful relationships.<\/a> <strong>Buddy Henika<\/strong>, Team Leader of Talent Acquisition at Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans spoke about his company\u2019s shift away from traditional mentors and new hire assignments, towards a more autonomous approach of allowing employees to find their own mentor within the company. They do so by holding networking and social events that lower the barrier of communication between new hires and senior level employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Make Onboarding an Interactive Experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical recruiting and onboarding methods simply won\u2019t work the same this fall season. Employers are not only looking to delegate meaningful work, but they are seeking creative ways to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/how-to-conduct-a-virtual-onboarding-for-new-hires\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make the virtual onboarding experience interactive<\/a> for early talent. Christie\u2019s team at SAS utilizes bi-weekly surveys with their intern class and managers to gauge and address immediate issues that may arise, but also to make sure that they have the experience that they\u2019re looking for. Through these surveys, they\u2019ve assessed their Net Promoter Score (NPS) at 85. Based on the global NPS standards, any score above 0 would be considered &#8220;good&#8221;, 50 and above being excellent while, 70 and above is considered &#8220;world class\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed out on the opportunity to attend our \u201cFind Your Next\u201d Preview Summit in June, join us on July 29 and 30 for our exclusive two-day <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/go.joinhandshake.com\/Find-your-next-launch-summit-july-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cFind Your Next\u201d Launch Summit event<\/a>.
