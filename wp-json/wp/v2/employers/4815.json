Diverse and inclusive workplaces are typically characterized by innovation, positive employee morale, and an improved bottom line. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cultureamp.com\/blog\/benefits-of-diversity-in-the-workplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Diverse teams add significant value to any organization<\/a>, but creating a representative workforce is a consistent challenge for many employers. To be more effective at engaging students from underrepresented backgrounds, let\u2019s first explore who these unique candidates are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is a diverse candidate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While those included in underrepresented minorities (URMs) and underrepresented groups (URGs) have come to include more and more people, the definition generally remains the same. An underrepresented minority is someone who is disproportionately less represented in a specific industry or field\u2014like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)\u2014 compared to the general population. URMs typically include people from minority race and ethnic backgrounds, like Black or Latinx, and sexual orientation and gender, like LGBTQ+ or women in STEM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because URMs are uniquely diverse people, employers need to communicate to them in a way that celebrates their uniqueness and their backgrounds while highlighting the value your organization places on inclusivity. Not sure where to start? We\u2019ll show you how to reach out to underrepresented minorities (and what not to do) to build a more talented and representative team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I message students from underrepresented backgrounds?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have internship opportunities and jobs to fill and you\u2019d like to build a more representative organization, so you\u2019ve decided to engage with candidates from varying backgrounds and experiences, including URMs. But where do you start?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of sending the same canned message to every student, take the time to personalize your outreach\u2014your recipients will appreciate it. Handshake\u2019s Campus to Career report revealed that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/handshakes-2019-campus-to-career-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">95% of students surveyed <em>prefer <\/em>to engage with employers that send personalized, proactive messages<\/a>. This is your chance to show candidates that you value them enough as individuals to not send them the same standard message everyone else gets.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few best practices to follow when messaging diverse talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Don\u2019t make assumptions <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Students from URGs aren\u2019t all the same. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/in-depth\/news\/nation\/2020\/01\/06\/more-hispanic-students-than-ever-go-college-but-cost-high\/2520646001\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nearly half of Latinx students are the first in their families to go to college<\/a>, but that doesn\u2019t mean that <em>every <\/em>Latinx student is a first-generation college student. Identifying with a certain underrepresented group doesn\u2019t take away a student\u2019s individuality. Treat students as individuals by avoiding generalizations or stereotyping them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Avoid tokenizing candidates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get caught up in diversity recruitment, but <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/diversity-together\/6-principles-for-messaging-underrepresented-candidates-on-handshake-7c70b224f39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students from underrepresented backgrounds prefer to be hired for their skills and expertise<\/a>, not their ethnic or racial status. Your messages need to reflect that. When you tell a URM student that you\u2019re messaging them because they\u2019re a minority, you risk offending or tokenizing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Avoid phrases like, \u201cLooking for black students for our STEM internship\u201d or \u201cLatinx women are invited to apply.\u201d Many Handshake employers go with a standard subject line like, \u201cYou received a message from [employer] on Handshake,\u201d which typically gets a 65% average open rate.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Consider your candidates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you reach out to students, you should first consider who they are, where they come from, and their motivations. For example, some employers still set GPA cutoffs to source qualified candidates when it\u2019s been proven to be an inaccurate indicator of job performance. It might not seem like a big deal until you consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/3-hiring-practices-that-disadvantage-black-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60% of Black student applications<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/want-more-latinx-candidates-try-these-3-hiring-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">56 percent of Latinx student applications<\/a> have a GPA below 3.5. Keep in mind that these students may have had unequal access to resources, skilled teachers, or may be working multiple jobs to support their families. Any of these could impact their GPA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Nix the GPA requirements. When Handshake Premium partner Whirlpool Corporation did this, their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toolbox.com\/hr\/employer-marketing\/interviews\/tim-streeter-whirlpool-student-recruitment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">percentage of URM hires increased from 30 to 40 percent YOY<\/a>.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>URM students are more likely to work part-time throughout school and therefore don\u2019t have the time to perfect their applications or track down the supplemental documents (e.g., transcripts, recommendation letters) needed to apply. Some are so busy that they can\u2019t meet strict recruiting deadlines. Encourage applications by recruiting year-round and giving busy candidates time to put together a quality application instead of rushing to just send something in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Be proactive and be relevant<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We all want to be wanted, and students are no different. Instead of waiting until you meet a student at a career fair or see that someone attended your virtual event, send messages proactively. The key is to engage with students who you\u2019re interested in, but that will also find your messages relevant. Sending a woman interested in marketing a message about your STEM internship will likely get ignored because it\u2019s not relevant to her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Check out students\u2019 profiles before messaging them. Nothing\u2019s worse than sending an irrelevant message to a candidate who tells other students about you spamming them (even if you didn\u2019t intend to spam them).<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Review students\u2019 profiles <em>before<\/em> messaging them<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Students work hard to create their online brand\u2014a digital representation of who they are. Handshake student profiles give valuable insights into a candidate, such as what kind of work they\u2019re looking for, which locations they want to work in, the specific roles they\u2019re interested in, any organizations they\u2019re part of, and more. Take this opportunity to get to know the candidate and leverage what\u2019s on their profile to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/how-to-write-a-recruiting-message-to-students-plus-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">personalize your outreach<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>6. Be authentic<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You expect candidates to be upfront and transparent with you, so candidates should expect the same from you. Students can quickly determine whether your message is an impersonal message that hundreds of other students received or if you put some thought into crafting your message. Connect with each student through personalized outreach and show them they can trust you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>7. Make your outreach personal<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Show candidates that you want to get to know them and that you did a little research by personalizing your messages. You can use Handshake to customize messages by using a student\u2019s first name, their major, school, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=614%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4824\" width=\"614\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=768%2C961&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=640%2C801&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?resize=1024%2C1281&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Campaign-message.png?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also tailor your messaging to URMs by showing that you support them through ERGs, mentors, or a representative leadership team. Be sure to highlight your employer brand and the value your organization puts on diversity and inclusion. Remember, students don\u2019t want to be labeled as diversity hires, so it\u2019s important employers don\u2019t make them feel that way.<br><br><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Share with candidates how URMs are strengthening your workforce with innovation, talk about the different employee resource groups (ERGs) you offer, or share an article or video from your women-led engineering team. Candidates want to see that you value their unique experiences and that they\u2019ll be fully supported with pathways for progression.<br><br>A less obvious but equally important way to personalize your outreach is to consider who is engaging with your candidates. We all want to see people who look like us or come from similar backgrounds at the company we\u2019re considering for an internship or full-time employment. <a href=\"https:\/\/go.joinhandshake.com\/rs\/390-ZTF-353\/images\/Handshake_Ambassadors_Datasheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual Ambassadors<\/a> can help bridge this gap. Invite your alumni ambassadors or former interns to connect with prospective URM students. They can speak about their experiences with your organization and give candidates a look into how you value diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Ambassadors on Handshake are typically alumni, department heads, former interns, or recent hires. Connect your ambassadors through messages to candidates, where they can share their excitement about your organization, answer questions, and discuss your ERGs or resources for URMs.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h4>8. Check your language<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re sending messages, it\u2019s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/writer.com\/inclusion-glossary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">double-check the words you\u2019re using<\/a>. You don\u2019t want to unintentionally offend a student because you used inappropriate lingo or you chose masculine language over gender-neutral. The best way to check yourself is to ask: Would I feel like I belonged at this company if I got this message?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Use inclusive language. Our Women in STEM report revealed <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/3-trends-impacting-women-in-stem-in-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">that words that suggest inclusivity and collaboration increase the number of women applicants, while words with more intense connotations typically decrease these applications<\/a>. Use inclusive, collaborate words in your job descriptions to attract more women to your STEM roles.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why employers should message URMs on Handshake<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Where<\/em> you message students is just as important as what you say. The 7M+ active students on Handshake come from all backgrounds, experiences and schools, including minority-serving institutions, which is why many employers start their outreach here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While any employer on Handshake can message early talent, Handshake Premium partners can better personalize<a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/solutions\/engage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> their Campaigns using Segments<\/a>, which allow them to create groups of students based on certain criteria and message them at scale. For example, employers looking to diversify their recruiting efforts can source qualified members of varying student organizations (e.g., Society of Women Engineers), institutions (e.g., HBCUs, MSIs), student interests, and more.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of smart segmentation and personalized, scalable outreach, Handshake Premium employers typically see the following compared to employers on Handshake Core:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>7-9x increase in applications from Black, Latinx, and women candidates<\/li><li><strong>2x+ more clicks<\/strong> to job postings, message links, or their website<\/li><li>Begin receiving applications to open jobs <strong>32 days sooner<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready to start messaging students from underrepresented backgrounds?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How you communicate with students from underrepresented backgrounds is important. They want to feel valued and appreciated for the unique experiences and skills they bring to the table, not feel like a diversity hire. Now that you\u2019ve got some best practices under your belt and actionable next steps for personalizing your outreach on Handshake, you can start building authentic, meaningful relationships with URMs and recruiting the right candidates for your open jobs or internships.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to get started? <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/employers\/request-more-info\/\"
