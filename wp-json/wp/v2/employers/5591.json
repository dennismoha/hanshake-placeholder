With 1 in 5 students at four-year institutions saying that COVID-19 had worsened their job search opportunities, the role of higher education institutions and employers in supporting students became more crucial than ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on insights from over 7M+ active students attending 1K+ partner schools, Handshake\u2019s 2020 Campus to Career Report is a deep dive into the latest trends, concerns, interests, and preferences for recent graduates entering the workforce.
