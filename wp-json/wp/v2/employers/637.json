This seems like a fair trade, but employers are finding that legacy strategies are proving insufficient. To capitalize on on-campus events, employers need to revamp their approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the highest return on your career fair investments\u200a\u2014\u200awhether recruiting tech talent or for any types of roles\u200a\u2014\u200aby following these five lessons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Lesson #1: Prep your job criteria and qualifications<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Make your company and your jobs not only discoverable, but also attractive to a variety of students. By using segments to define student audiences (i.e. who your jobs will show up in front of), you can both&nbsp;<strong>hone in and expand.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hone in<\/strong>: Use STEM and TEM filters to find top tech talent, search for specific technical skills to fit your unique job descriptions, or filter for relevant clubs and organizations.<\/li><li><strong>Expand<\/strong>: Don\u2019t limit your qualifications to just major or GPA, there are a world of other measures out there! Look for students passionate about building things or ones with exceptional communication skills. And how about previous work experience?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Lesson #2: Build relationships before you&nbsp;go<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re showing up to a brand new school with no relationships\u200a\u2014\u200aor even a school you\u2019ve been to for years\u200a\u2014\u200aarmed with just a folding table and a box of swag, you might be in for a rude awakening. Let students know you\u2019re coming! Invite them! And, it\u2019s more than likely that even though you\u2019re looking for these students, they are not looking for you (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you know that 77% of students would prefer to join a company that proactively reached out to them, but only 20% of students have every received a message from an employer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tremendous opportunity for employers. Recruiters that listen to their candidates are sure to come out ahead. But even more than that, simply<em>raising awareness<\/em>&nbsp;can be everything. A student that has heard of your brand\u200a\u2014\u200ajust knows of its existence\u200a\u2014\u200ais much more likely to engage at a career fair than one that doesn\u2019t recognize your logo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/mt-bank-optimizes-on-campus-visits-with-proactive-outreach-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">M&amp;T Bank, a lesser known Fortune 500 Bank located in Buffalo, NY, leveraged Handshake to maximize visibility prior to college visits<\/a>\u200a\u2014\u200aoptimizing time and resources on-campus and generating thousands of qualified applicants. By sending personalized messages to students that fit specific location interest, skill, and past experience criteria, they filled their pipeline with 161% more qualified applicants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"308\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/fairs.png?resize=800%2C308&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/fairs.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/fairs.png?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/fairs.png?resize=768%2C296&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/fairs.png?resize=640%2C246&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Lesson #3: Put your best, most authentic foot&nbsp;forward<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Employer brand is top of mind of all recruiting organizations today. In fact, over 79% of employers have identified&nbsp;<strong>building their employer brand amongst students<\/strong>&nbsp;as a top priority in today\u2019s fight for top young talent (Handshake Employer Customer Survey, Summer 2018). So how do you do this? And more crucially, how do you do this&nbsp;<em>authentically?<\/em><br>Consider the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is your company\u2019s mission? What values permeate throughout your culture?<\/li><li>How can you show a more representative, inclusive face of your company?<\/li><li>What sets your company and these positions apart?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employer branding isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all exercise across the student population. You want to appeal to many different personalities across many different backgrounds to make sure you are growing the most diverse and multifaceted team possible. Everyone loves to feel wanted, important, and not alone\u200a\u2014\u200aand students are no different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Lesson #4: Show students careers, not&nbsp;jobs<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Z isn\u2019t looking for a 9\u20135, they are looking for a meaningful career and to make an impact. Show students that you care about their longer term career and personal growth\u200a\u2014\u200aprovide mentorship programs, future education opportunities, camaraderie and community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some quick tips on how to illustrate that you truly care about their development:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have testimonials and anecdotes of past interns and young employees readily available. If your budget allows, maybe even bring one with you to talk to prospects about his or her experience!<\/li><li>Show highlights (photos and videos) of your culture, benefits offered, and facilities. How are they conducive to work-life balance? How is your company providing recent grads with fruitful and positive experiences?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Lesson #5: Engage students after meeting&nbsp;them<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might seem obvious, it\u2019s a necessity that often falls through the cracks. A simple, personalized follow up message after meeting a student on-campus can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Boost employer brand across the student population\u200a\u2014\u200astudents talk!<\/li><li>Promote continuation of the relationship\u200a\u2014\u200aone conversation isn\u2019t enough, maintain an open dialogue<\/li><li>Build a long-term talent pipeline\u200a\u2014\u200aa student you\u2019ve engaged during his or her sophomore year will be primed to accept your offer come senior year<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With our newest product suite for Fall\u200a\u2014\u200athe Talent Engagement Suite\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re including Event Check-in functionality, which will help you centralize all career fair activity on Handshake. Make sure to take notes and record students\u2019 preferred roles right after your conversations so your follow up can be targeted and individualized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s possible now to create a seamless candidate experience\u200a\u2014\u200afrom before you step foot on-campus to a student\u2019s first day on the job.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We
