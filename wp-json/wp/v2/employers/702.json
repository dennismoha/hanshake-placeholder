Some of the biggest barriers to opportunity are because of a student\u2019s access to advice and insights on how to navigate the professional world, or lack thereof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To help bridge the information gap for all students, we\u00a0recently launched Student Reviews.\u00a0<\/strong>Reviews allow students to learn from the job and internship experiences of other students across the Handshake network, equipping all students with an informed career exploration and job search process. Handshake is uniquely positioned to help foster a learning environment across our community of 9 million students and young alumni from more than 500 schools of every size, type and location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Reviews also provide more opportunities for employers to engage students and further promote their brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are&nbsp;three best practices<\/strong>&nbsp;to help you turn the feedback loop into a critical recruiting tool that will fill your pipeline with informed and engaged candidates:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ec3d\"><strong>1. Respond to Student&nbsp;Reviews<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;65% of job seekers say their perception of a company improves after seeing an employer respond to a review.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Edelman Trust Barometer<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Reviews on Handshake give you the opportunity to communicate directly with your former interns on their experiences. Positive or negative, you are now invited to join the conversation and share your side too. When responding, we recommend keeping the following tips in mind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Engage:&nbsp;<\/strong>While companies aren&#8217;t obligated to respond to a review, we encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to engage with students. Responding can showcase how your company takes feedback seriously and values it from all levels.<\/li><li><strong>Be Empathetic:<\/strong>&nbsp;Authenticity and empathy are key for today\u2019s students. If a review includes constructive feedback, acknowledge the reviewer\u2019s comments and provide additional information on ways the company is addressing those issues.<\/li><li><strong>Offer Follow Up<\/strong>: Reviews are a starting point for a broader conversation that can take place one-on-one. To gain further insight about a student\u2019s experience, you can offer a follow up to take the conversation offline.<\/li><li><strong>Say Thank You!:<\/strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to provide a supportive and open community that encourages balanced feedback, but we know it can feel daunting for a student to press submit with their name attached. Dropping a quick note just to say \u201cthanks!\u201d can go a long way for a student.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c4 out of 5 candidates look to company reviews and ratings when making job decisions.\u201d<br>U.S. Harris Poll<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Activate Your Interns as Brand Ambassadors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Positive reviews are your most valuable recruiting asset. With the majority of job seekers<strong>&nbsp;reading up to seven reviews before forming an opinion about a company<\/strong>&nbsp;(Source: Glassdoor U.S. Site Survey), it\u2019s crucial that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You&nbsp;<em>have&nbsp;<\/em>reviews<\/li><li>They are either positive or constructively addressed (see best practice #1)<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So where to begin?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leverage the resources you already have<\/strong>: current and former interns!
