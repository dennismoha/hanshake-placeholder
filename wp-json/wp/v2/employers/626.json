In the year since Box redesigned their recruitment strategy, they saw a&nbsp;<strong>5x<\/strong>&nbsp;increase in applications from underrepresented candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Box is a Bay Area-based tech company that serves over 82,000 businesses across all industries. If you\u2019re accessing work files on the cloud (e.g., a Powerpoint deck for on-campus info sessions), there is a good chance that Box is where they\u2019re stored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily\u2019s small but mighty team of three recruits for a variety of roles across the business including software engineering, sales, internal consulting, and customer support. Emily and I discussed the unique elements of their plan &#8211; specifically, how their strategy brilliantly covers every stage of the applicant journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following sections, we\u2019ll cover:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The revamping of Box\u2019s hiring process and how&nbsp;<strong>university recruiting<\/strong>&nbsp;is a key driver of their D&amp;I strategy<\/li><li>Box\u2019s approach to creating a rich and an&nbsp;<strong>inclusive employer brand<\/strong>&nbsp;to attract underrepresented students from across the country<\/li><li>How Box integrates&nbsp;<strong>affinity groups<\/strong>&nbsp;into the recruiting process so candidates know they have a community<\/li><li>The benefits of creating an&nbsp;<strong>equitable interview process<\/strong>, and how Box did it<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"d0f5\">Revamping the hiring process<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cOur executive team has always been supportive of diversity and inclusion, but when we identified that we needed to redo our hiring process, this was a big ask. We were able to generate buy-in by aligning the program not just to D&amp;I goals, but to other business priorities.\u201d &#8211; Emily Vogel<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, Box\u2019s university recruitment team decided to focus on two trends:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Demographic shifts in the population:<\/strong>&nbsp;According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/publications\/2015\/demo\/p25-1143.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Census<\/a>, by 2040, the majority of the US population will be people of color.<\/li><li><strong>Gender and ethnic diversity on teams:<\/strong>&nbsp;A recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/organization\/our-insights\/why-diversity-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">McKinsey &amp; Company study&nbsp;<\/a>found that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Box identified trends in the U.S. workforce to get hiring managers thinking about how diversity, or lack thereof, could impact their team, product, and future success of the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"2153\">University recruiting as a key driver of Box\u2019s diversity strategy<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe received over 6,000 applications for only 15 summer internships spots. While, in theory, our pipeline was robust and had talented students, it was not diverse, and for our business and culture to thrive, we needed to proactively create a pipeline representative of America\u2019s diversity.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;<\/em>Emily Vogel<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid a homogeneous pipeline, Box increased the number of schools they recruited at and focused on schools with high populations of underrepresented students (including but not limited to HBCUs, and HSIs). Box also expand job criteria to include non-traditional majors, backgrounds, and skills (i.e., for sales roles, include liberal arts students).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team of three, and we don\u2019t have the time or budget to go to every campus, but the schools not on our core and target list had strong talent, were incredibly diverse, and the students weren\u2019t even aware of tech companies as an option. For students at those schools, we become a unique and exciting opportunity.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Emily Vogel<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Box discontinued their&nbsp;<em>core school list<\/em>&nbsp;approach&nbsp;<\/strong>and opted for an open school approach to reach and attract more underrepresented talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what happened when they expanded their school list from 6 to more than 200:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>84%<\/strong>&nbsp;of Box\u2019s job views are from students going to school outside of California<\/li><li>They received&nbsp;<strong>5x&nbsp;<\/strong>more applications than their industry peers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"76c7\">Box\u2019s approach to branding<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cEnterprise software can sound pretty boring, but our culture is much closer to a startup. We have to bring that picture to the forefront of the pitch to students.\u201d &#8211; Emily Vogel<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Box launched it\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.box.com\/careers\/business-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Business Fellowship<\/a>&nbsp;for underrepresented students to gain business experience. The alternative spring break brought together 15 students from across the country. They spent the week at Box\u2019s headquarters learning about different career paths available in the tech industry like sales, customer support, finance, and HR teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the misconception that you have to have an engineering background to join a tech company. For example, after introducing a group of students to the HR team on a tour of our office, one student said, \u2018Wow! All of them are engineers!\u2019 We created the fellowship to dispel the myth that you had to be a software engineer here.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Emily Vogel<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1252\" height=\"1118\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?fit=1024%2C914&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?w=1252&amp;ssl=1 1252w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?resize=768%2C686&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?resize=1024%2C914&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?resize=640%2C572&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/branding.png?resize=1200%2C1072&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption>Box\u2019s interactive profile page on Handshake<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Box\u2019s proactive branding efforts on Handshake resulted in a:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>68% message read rate<\/strong>&nbsp;among students when recruiters sent student direct messages.<\/li><li><strong>70% lift in brand page views<\/strong>&nbsp;year-over-year<\/li><li><strong>They also hired many students&nbsp;<\/strong>-one student shared her Fellowship experience&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/take-risks-box-business-felowship-jennifer-garcia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>, and encouraged more student to apply!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cHandshake\u2019s advanced filters save valuable time, especially given how small our UR team is. I think almost all UR teams are understaffed and with the amount of inbound you get from active candidates, it can sometimes be hard to justify sourcing, but sourcing is a crucial strategy to connect with students of underrepresented talent, especially from different schools and especially as we\u2019ve found in business roles.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Emily Vogel<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"c55b\">Affinity groups at Box<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWhen we decided to reach more schools, we partnered with our affinity groups and integrated them into the recruiting process so candidates know they have a community.

They play a significant role in Box\u2019s inclusive culture and attraction strategy. At Box, they organize recruiting events and serve as mentors for candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When one intern candidate, who cared about her experience as a woman in engineering, Emily connected her with Box\u2019s Women in Technology (WIT) group. After having a phone conversation with one of the members, the candidate shared with Emily that she had a deeper understanding of the internship opportunity and Box\u2019s culture. She ultimately chose Box for her summer internship, and now she meets regularly with the (WIT) group and organizes community events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with active and a diverse affinity group members, candidates are engaged and ask authentic questions like, \u201cwhat does it feel like to be a Latina engineer here?\u201d and receive an authentic and transparent answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"51cb\">How Box created an equitable interview process<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Box had struggled to hire women who were software engineers. The previous year they made 10 offers to women, but none accepted. Emily shared with me, \u201cwe realized we needed a big change and so we decide to completely redo our hiring process.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old interview process gave applicants limited time to ask hiring managers questions about Box\u2019s culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1007\" height=\"131\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png?resize=1007%2C131&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png?w=1007&amp;ssl=1 1007w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png?resize=300%2C39&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png?resize=768%2C100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1.png?resize=640%2C83&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new process included a two-week take-home test with resources and \u201coffice hours\u201d with the engineers\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"130\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png?resize=1002%2C130&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png?resize=300%2C39&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png?resize=768%2C100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png?resize=640%2C83&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The results?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"966\" height=\"190\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png?resize=966%2C190&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-631\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png?w=966&amp;ssl=1 966w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png?resize=300%2C59&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png?resize=768%2C151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png?resize=640%2C126&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only did the new process help Box build better connections with students, but it also helped differentiate Box as an employer that cared about their candidates, and was prioritizing diversity and inclusion. One student interviewee shared:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI really enjoyed the take-home exercise.

students apply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily offered parting advice for employers on the webinar, urging them to identify new, innovative, and engaging recruitment strategies, that will differentiate them as
