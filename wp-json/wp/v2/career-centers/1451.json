It might seem straight-forward or intuitive, but the more consistent and relevant the message is, the more students will understand and believe in the value of the tool \u2014 most notably, what makes Handshake different than the other resources they are probably using.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, we have two essential resources for you. The first is a straightforward messaging overview that will provide you with succinct descriptions of Handshake\u2019s value and pre-packaged answers to some of the most frequently asked questions you

second is a set of student-facing one-pagers, which we\u2019ve created to communicate: <strong>what is Handshake, why should I use Handshake, and how do I use Handshake.<\/strong> We encourage you to distribute these as broadly and extensively across your campus as possible<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>To-do today<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Download and distribute to your team this \u201ccheat sheet\u201d for
