Christine and Andy outline three key trends that will have an impact upon universities\u2019 survival:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Enrollment\/Demographic Changes:<\/strong> Universities must be prepared to serve an increasingly diverse student population, those who are underrepresented, from low-income households, or the first generation to attend college. These are the same populations employers seek as they diversify their own organizations.<\/li><li><strong>Virtual:<\/strong> The virtual mode of interaction <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/virtual-recruiting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>increases access<\/strong><\/a> for underrepresented students, and most employers are incorporating virtual capabilities into their recruiting practices. Institutions must be proactive in adopting the appropriate technology and hosting virtual opportunities for students to ensure they\u2019re setting them up for success.<\/li><li><strong>Skills:<\/strong> Employers are utilizing technology to identify students with relevant credentials and skills. Students need to add credentials and work-integrated learning experiences to their areas of academic focus.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Metrics that matter during college and outcomes that matter after college<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To rethink how career services is integrated into the institution\u2019s strategic plans, leaders must first agree on a common set of career readiness metrics\u2014measured during and after college\u2014that define success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whitepaper outlines examples of metrics and outcomes for institutions to consider when measuring their progress. The metrics and outcomes, while detailed, are not actually complex. Their goal is to get to the heart of understanding students\u2019 sense of career and life readiness, how they perceive their school in important dimensions, and how their academic experience aligns with their career path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples outlined in the whitepaper include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Metrics during college<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Student engagement:<\/strong> number of student appointments with career centers or mentors, number of interviews students attend, etc.<\/li><li><strong>Experiential learning:<\/strong> percentage of academic programs with integrated internship(s) and work-based learning; percentage of students engaged in internships, intensive research projects, and service learning; etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Outcomes after college<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Outcome satisfaction:<\/strong> How happy are students with their employment, graduate school, or other outcome?<\/li><li><strong>Social capital:<\/strong> How have students\u2019 connections from college (students, alumni, employers, faculty, etc.) helped them in their career development?<\/li><li><strong>Applied competencies:<\/strong> What specific knowledge and skills from college have students used in their career?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a
