While job searching can often feel like a one-way street, receiving an employer message is an opportunity to connect with a company that is ready and excited to engage. It can even <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/handshake-helped-me-land-two-internship-offers\/\">lead to a job offer without ever needing to send in a resume<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our research further highlights how much value students get out of employer messages. A <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/handshakes-2019-campus-to-career-report\/\">Handshake survey<\/a> found that 82 percent of students and young alumni prefer learning about career opportunities through online communication like in-platform messages from a recruiter. <strong>Ninety-five percent of students engage with employers that send personalized, proactive messages<\/strong>, whether by reviewing their company profile, applying for a job, or signing up for an event.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>\u201cWhen I first heard from Chase, it was super surprising.

To <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/how-to-write-a-recruiting-message-to-students-plus-examples\/\">keep their messages relevant and personalized<\/a>, employers can search for and reach out to students that match their ideal candidate profiles. Over <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/why-students-should-fill-out-handshake-profile\/\">80 percent of students who fill out their Handshake profile get an employer message<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the era of virtual-first recruiting, employers are doubling down on connecting with students through proactive messaging. Since March, we\u2019ve seen a <strong>257% uptick in employer messages sent through Handshake<\/strong>. Recently, we surpassed <strong>one million messages sent to students in a single week<\/strong>. High engagement rates with students across the board have encouraged employers of all shapes and sizes to incorporate proactive messaging into their core recruiting strategy. There has never been a more critical time for students to fill out their profiles and get noticed by recruiters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>\u201cEver since I\u2019ve updated my skills, I had three Fortune 500 companies reach out to me about a summer internship opportunity.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p><cite><em>Alejandra, student at Wake Forest University<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming Soon<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To give our higher ed partners an even more comprehensive picture of student and employer engagement with messaging on Handshake, we\u2019re building an <strong>Employer Messaging Dashboard<\/strong> to help you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visualize which employers are sending the most messages to your students<\/li><li>Uncover which types of students are getting the most messages<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay in the loop about this and other exciting updates, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360024437094\">enable the Handshake Point of Contact role on your account<\/a>.
