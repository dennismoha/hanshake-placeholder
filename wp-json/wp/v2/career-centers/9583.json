The virtual conference was free for all attendees and featured sessions that focused on re-envisioning the future of career education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our speakers represented diverse perspectives across the higher education landscape, such as <strong><em>New York Times<\/em> bestselling author, Lindsey Pollak; verteran education journalist, Paul Fain; and many other Handshake partners<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are four key takeaways from the two-day conference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Virtual recruiting is here to stay<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we look to fall 2021 and beyond, it\u2019s clear that\u2014even as colleges reopen\u2014virtual recruiting is here to stay. During the <em>Creating Certainty in Uncertainty <\/em>session, <strong>Kevin Grubb from Villanova University<\/strong> and <strong>Todd Good from IBM<\/strong> joined <strong>Handshake\u2019s Chief Education Strategy Officer, Christine Cruzvergara<\/strong>, to reflect on the past year and discuss their approach to virtual recruiting in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pMbpBpueTcQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to acknowledge the pivot that many institutions had to make, but Kevin Grubb mentioned that the \u201cwriting was on the wall\u201d for digital-first recruitment before the pandemic and that the past year accelerated their shift.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the fall approaching, Grubb\u2019s advice to institutions was to first think about their \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014the purpose of their work as a career center. For Grubb and his team, their \u201cwhy\u201d is two-fold\u2014to empower students to have agency in their career journey and to make that path more accessible. From there, Grubb said it\u2019s important for institutions to reassess how the \u201cwhy\u201d is delivered. In Villanova\u2019s case, virtual is the \u201chow of the why.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to new survey results from Handshake Network Trends, 87% of students said they still prefer some aspect of virtual recruiting in a post-COVID world. Also, 4 out of 5 employers said they will continue to conduct virtual career events when pandemic restrictions are no longer a concern. While there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach, institutions need to rethink the role that virtual will play in their strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Be comfortable with change<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Change isn\u2019t easy. But if this year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re all capable of driving meaningful change. In our keynote session, <strong>Lindsey<\/strong> <strong>Pollak<\/strong> spoke about the notion of \u201crecalculating\u201d and how higher education has the opportunity to rethink the future for students. Her five steps for recalculating were especially insightful for the audience\u2014they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Embrace curiosity and creativity<\/li><li>Prioritize action<\/li><li>Focus on what you can control<\/li><li>Know your non-negotiables<\/li><li>Ask for help<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jJX33N-33vU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Focus on outcomes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessing and demonstrating career progress is more important than ever as students, families, and policy makers seek common measures to determine the employment returns from higher education institutions. In our <em>Metrics that Matter<\/em> panel, <strong>Dave Clayton from Strada Education Network, Kristina Francis from JFFLabs at Jobs for the Future, and Andy Chan from Wake Forest University<\/strong> joined <strong>Felice Nudelman from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)<\/strong> to discussed the metrics that help institutions articulate the career value they provide to their students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Chan mentioned that establishing an outcomes-focused data strategy is a \u201cchallenging problem\u201d for many institutions, especially those less-resourced, but that it\u2019s necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hcuncqmnETc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Ensure access and equity in all facets of career services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we ensure that students of all backgrounds are equipped to build a great career?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During <em>Access 2021<\/em>, <strong>Christine Cruzvergara<\/strong> spoke in her <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/a-vision-for-democratizing-access-for-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Welcome Address<\/a> <\/strong>about the opportunity that we have to craft a new future to increase access and deliver more equitable outcomes for students. We also heard this during our <em>Equity, Justice, and Belonging <\/em>session as our panelists\u2014<strong>Michael Ellison, Amelia Parnell, Angie Kamath and Elyse Ashburn<\/strong>\u2014discussed practical ways to redesign career services, particularly for students of color.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Ellison, CEO of CodePath.org,<\/strong> left the audience with some advice on measuring success of career services:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re thinking about measuring your success from a career services standpoint or job outcome standpoint, measure your success not on your most privileged or most prepared students but on your most disadvantaged students. If you\u2019re designing and measuring on that, it\u2019s going to lead to better programs for everybody.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video
