It depends who you ask.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>45% of career centers say students are still adjusting to a new virtual norm and almost 38% sense that their students are experiencing virtual fatigue. Only 17.5% of career centers see students embracing the turn to virtual.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a rosy picture when considering a year ahead in which almost all interaction\u2014academic, campus, recruiting, and employment\u2014will almost certainly be virtual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, career center sentiment may not reflect student reality. In a survey of 1,005 students conducted at the same time, <strong>students reported somewhat more positive feelings about going virtual<\/strong>\u2014at least when discussing possible jobs and internships. 51% of all students surveyed are either open or very open to taking a fully virtual job after graduation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"524\" height=\"324\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/mjJznmfIB121VI3Vu5PqrBNFRGA5BE7AYJh8g41-fK3ImcS29BI1gVwsoh-BMuppkgxRC9VDHPSglQ_PeYAYqY-BLwVsl-HfOnCcPwGbti3yjGKFOh2aVMAW-UtANKGLVYnjgxto\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, students who <strong>had a virtual job or internship adapted well to the new environment: <\/strong>49% said the experience was around the same as they expected and 41% said the experience was easier than expected.\u00a0<br><strong>And, going forward, some students might just prefer virtual<\/strong>: 50% of students who had a virtual or hybrid internship would prefer to work remotely at least part-time in the future, with 28% happy to continue working fully remote, 22% open to working part-time remote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to help students? It\u2019s still business as usual.&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, <strong>students say they still need help from career centers with the basics of finding a career opportunity<\/strong>. The most common requests career centers receive from students during COVID-19 are help with a job search (31%), followed by help with resume\/cover letter (23%), and help with an internship (21%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 2% say they are being asked to help with support for basic needs, such as food and housing during the pandemic. It is likely that students are finding these resources elsewhere from their network or university, or they are coping well enough without additional support.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where are students looking for opportunity?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as early as the summer, 54.5% career centers noted that their students were shifting interest to new careers and industries since the outbreak of COVID-19.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"623.5\" height=\"168\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/BU5UXCjeM6hdGEIxsmMbRhHfaflJrP4cUSx9vRzzfwnEj6lIquigkjhOlvPuqhoQzNGeQVZJMUc1GjItLACD9uKk_-X4Sz8SkvcEQVT8ZLXCUBZ1YPgMjabljfe68nE8vs3qh_IC\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a bit of good news for non-graduating students: on-campus jobs at the schools surveyed seem to either be continuing or moving to virtual, with only 7% cancelled.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>PART 2: Institutional Finances and Operations<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Career centers are experiencing financial hardship and increased pressure to prove value.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, <strong>40% of career centers predicted their enrollment would be down<\/strong>\u2014only 19.5% said that they did <em>not<\/em> believe enrollment would be negatively affected by COVID-19. Another 40% said they weren\u2019t sure, which is likely to now be the case for an even larger group. A May 1 enrollment deadline is no longer the bedrock of predictability in admissions\u2014shifting plans from universities and changing health and safety data mean that real enrollment numbers likely won\u2019t be solidified until classes are fully in session.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s at least one silver lining to some of the confusion around fall plans: <strong>The majority of career centers are at least somewhat involved in fall contingency planning for their institution<\/strong>. 16% are very involved and 47% are somewhat involved. Unfortunately, about 37% aren\u2019t involved at all.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, higher education career centers are bracing for financial impact\u2014or already dealing with the blow. <strong>A full 50% of career centers surveyed have had their budget cut.<\/strong> 57% have had a hiring freeze. Furloughs, salary cuts, and layoffs are also occurring, although less often. 15% of respondents shared nuanced responses ranging from \u201cwe\u2019re not sure yet\u201d to less discretionary funding, cuts to student staff, move to a 9-month employment year, university reductions in retirement contributions, and more.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"490\" height=\"198\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/59vo6k8_1bTadtUOWYbdLagE8CFONBGGgh2BRHywqYP2j-OBeZZ3m456RW2MLFQFS0ZNhbiwGTTJs4mOiuwt5_luMS2dFHvGOruRd6K43m4k9W7JqBrWdbbYQMdUb7wAagD7rS0G\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings indicate a sense of having to do the same with less, suggested by 41% of respondents saying they need technology to help with efficiency in light of these cuts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Under financial duress, increased pressure to prove value<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By July, <strong>19.5% of career centers had already been asked to demonstrate their value to the university<\/strong> since COVID-19; a further 40.5% planned to do so .&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ways that career centers plan to show their value is varied. The two largest strategies are around <strong>evidence of engagement<\/strong> and <strong>evidence of outcomes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first category, career centers are relying on how <em>much<\/em> engagement they are facilitating virtually: 86% say they\u2019ll try to show increased virtual engagement programming and 67% will try to show increased 1:1 engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latter category, career centers are looking to show <em>why it matters<\/em>: <strong>59% of career centers ranked evidence of more placements and 55% ranked evidence of more applications<\/strong> as the metric to prove their value to institutional leadership.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/1Dz8MIQAZ4XBrpnNe4qouRszIfM8eQrzBPZvtU61AlXhp2d2_XhXF_1Lk0EAwjCb7ckjx_DxWb2CAdro8w4C6h5oeMC0FnBrh7nqg4bm4vq5PNKtuho0T1oYVbOo4rWepEhd1mGG\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>vast majority (96%) of career centers are looking to a career services platform (like Handshake) to find this data<\/strong>, though 64% said they\u2019d be looking to their own documents and excel files to surface evidence of their value.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>PART 3: Predictions for the Future<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A sober view of COVID-19\u2019s effect on student opportunity, long term.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, reduction of resources for career services will negatively affect institutional goals around student equity and outcomes. Career services predict the top three results of these cuts will be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Fewer students securing jobs and internships<\/li><li>Immediate to long-term negative impact on social mobility for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds or for historically underrepresented students<\/li><li>Immediate impact of fewer students applying for jobs and internships.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Career center leaders predict the largest effect of COVID-19 on the network for college recruiting will be <strong>less opportunity and a more competitive market<\/strong>, but also <strong>more remote job and internship opportunities<\/strong> for students. About 11% of career centers believe that the chief effect of COVID-19 on recruiting will be less diversity because of the disproportionate disadvantage experienced by low-income and marginalized students.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"303\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ryqHIg9TMCuqABF9oTmkQBrWFQx38Hi0BCdWWfb4SIkJMiRQfJ8wBxMreDh8QDpPZbLNf6VYUovFUSQG28MA1SDp2zv5Yi2aAS7FvuRumFySL6GZ-H7LsboyBq2YZnEVplBZZaWw\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Career Centers see a fundamental shift to virtual this semester\u2014and beyond.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, career services anticipate that 92% of fairs will be virtual in their Fall 2020 plan. 69% agree or strongly agree that virtual career fairs will become accepted standard practice, even after students are back on campus. Finally, <strong>most (76%) career centers think more virtual engagement options for student, employer, and higher ed connection will become the norm in the future as a result of COVID-19<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>With COVID-19 altering higher education and early talent recruitment as we know it, career leaders face a long-term shift to virtual, institutional financial hardships, and the toughest job market for their students in a decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While students remain flexible to the virtual landscape, budget cuts, reduced resources, and a competitive job market are predicted to have long-term effects on student opportunity, directly influencing institutional goals around equity and student outcomes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time when constraints are unavoidable, career leaders have an opportunity to double down on efforts that bring the greatest value with the most efficiency, and to tie these successes back to institutional goals. Now, more than ever, career education is critical to higher ed\u2019s mission of advancing student success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reflections from career services leaders about the short and long-term effects of COVID-19 on their work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034972,"featured_media":4319,"menu_order":0,"template":"","career_centers_category":[1417],"career_centers_tag":[1497,1447],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Handshake Career Services Report: COVID-19 &amp;
