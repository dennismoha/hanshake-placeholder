At <em>Handshake Access 2021<\/em>, and again in July and September, we hosted a presentation called <em>Reimagining the Employer Trust Score<\/em>. In it, we discussed our plans to enhance the process for approving employers and jobs for your students by updating our Trust Score and flagging system.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/reimagining-the-employer-trust-score-encore-webinar-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">You can watch the full presentation here<\/a>, or read on for a summary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just about every school in the Handshake network will tell you that reviewing employers and jobs takes a lot of time. Schools new to Handshake typically see a 2-3x increase in reputable job postings versus their old system. As a result, they spend an average of 240 hours per year vetting incoming employers and jobs for legitimacy and fit for their students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, new employers on Handshake often struggle to get a foothold. The existing <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/1500005548481\">Trust Score<\/a> amalgamates various factors to help schools vet employers; however, those factors become opaque when reduced to a 0-100 score. 55% of employer requests are ultimately declined. This disproportionately disadvantages smaller employers, who don\u2019t always have the time or resources to understand the Trust Score.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? On average, <strong><em>students see about 3% of available job postings on Handshake.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve spent the last year discussing these challenges with schools and employers. We worked closely with our Trust &amp; Safety Advisory Board, representing over 20 different institutions, to ensure that the solution would benefit our school partners. As a result, we identified opportunities to make employer and job approvals more nuanced, transparent, and safe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWe really appreciate the attention that Handshake provides&#8230;you all are ridiculously attentive to your clients, and truly take the feedback we share with you seriously.\u201d<\/em><\/p><cite><em>Craig Marinello, Manager of Student Employment and Internship Development | Southeastern Louisiana University | Trust &amp; Safety Advisory Board Member<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than depending on the Trust Score to stand in for the myriad reasons an employer might not be a fit for your students, our solution separates employer fraud, employer profile validity, and school fit into distinct buckets. This will help schools make more informed decisions around approvals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/Rr7MPZpSxx3k2OwuXAG9rlhm3-KfRlWOUWifdnn5kwrbZAZJvIglwn5KnqdCuFQ8SewxzHwkqtXldfUQCIBeRuwhtGhUqs61Y5I3YvDdPovFwq048lvB0XqOjJNm0YrJLEJbDTTW\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flags that focus on fraud and abuse<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employer flags were developed as a way to identify bad actors and remove them from the Handshake network. However, over time, we\u2019ve seen a plurality of flags fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. This reduces the efficacy of the flagging mechanism, as it obscures genuine flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/gipH9cVvgwVdtk-sS2af9kEa3BR85QQah2S2H8OKdsY8YokoUgTpy0RHHFTwvZEpPvmemE--pMTru3AsItevrjX2ZNP290pVA45YtHVgxtEgcf65_4vV8-OXDGBvZG8hOmdXMZFa\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"248\" title=\"Chart\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve this challenge, we will:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Revamp flag taxonomy to focus only on fraud and abuse<\/li><li>Allow schools and students to flag both employers and employer users<\/li><li>Notify schools when a previously approved employer receives a legitimate flag for fraud or abuse<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our updated flag reasons below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/FB8MB7xss5zDyL1DFBC71Z2m86HSveUMXupdVnhuP8FKZI3cDefC4LV3ryhim_p6KBY67yL0L2c8B8WccT0Q5nFgJ2dFkxSnmz-fR65DZJMTrLO-htKhhREQ6UXm1zIbzw4BpHna\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"338\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>More nuanced reasons to decline employers and jobs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, when you decline an employer on the index page, you\u2019re given the option to provide a reason. Doing so can help employers better understand your decision and provide a signal to Handshake (and your peers) about the fit of the employer for your students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, today, decline reasons aren\u2019t required everywhere in Handshake (only on the index page), and can\u2019t be used to help other schools make approval decisions. They also play double or triple duty, acting both as flags and to call out missing profile information that should be required (more on the latter in the next section). Furthermore, decline reasons don\u2019t exist for jobs\u2014just employers. Including job decline reasons could provide additional signals\u2014for instance, what if the employer is legitimate, but the job isn\u2019t the right fit for your students?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve these challenges, we\u2019re updating employer decline reasons, adding job decline reasons that focus specifically on \u201cfit\u201d for a school, and prompting for decline reasons throughout the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Yx3gKalFecFbFAtNgJSqbLpjW8fnexI5yUS0Cn0vGLWE1Tfp5sANba2crII_kxaf9isefaTdwVR3JXSl2tKbc8dwWwOq8OkGU_a1F16CXmIJAAXfe6SYp-77Z6BmOUYsDerRRz3U\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/yuFl5wr0TQnLTaBq4uIYmjSIfI2b1397AjWgrreXs8I5Oq68L01G4ycuwJZVGdkXPDu3DaE8a43AnY-Zfi0HnABG5JHNfTXZ3URMVHeP1HRy9pGtDbIGx69nqtPuDwDzhyPdE94u\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"338\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, we\u2019ll be able to map decline reasons to employers on the backend of Handshake. Then, we will be able to provide nuanced filters to help you quickly decline employers or jobs based on information from your peers. For example, if your institution does not approve third party employers, in the future you will be able to easily identify and decline them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reimagining the Trust Score<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands today, the Trust Score focuses on four main inputs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sufficient employer profile information<\/li><li>Age of employer on the Handshake network<\/li><li>Number of school approvals and declines<\/li><li>Existing flags<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every new employer has a Trust Score of N\/A until they get their first job posting approved. There is also no distinction between different reasons an employer is declined. A decline is a decline, as far as the Trust Score is concerned, even if the employer is legitimate and the issue is simply school fit. Finally, the age requirement of the Trust Score unfairly disadvantages new employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With flags focused on suspected fraud and decline reasons focused on fit, Handshake\u2019s initial assessment can focus specifically on validating employer profile information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new process of employer validation will determine whether the employer\u2019s profile information proves their legitimacy. <strong><em>In its new form, the process of validation can be completely handled by Handshake. <\/em><\/strong>This change eliminates the need for the old Trust Score, which we\u2019ll phase out in 2022. Plus, <strong><em>schools will not have to take the time to manually review new employers&#8217; profile information. <\/em><\/strong>Any employer on the Handshake network will have first been validated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employer validation will have two tracks\u2014either way, an employer must be validated before they can do anything on Handshake:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Automatic Validation: <\/strong>Provide enough profile information to be validated near-instantaneously.<\/li><li><strong>Manual Validation: <\/strong>Provide available profile information and work with Handshake\u2019s Trust &amp; Safety Team to be validated manually in a day or two.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see these two tracks laid out below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/VTcftF8OS_VAQX0OYmHyAKXx0yOT2_tC4HVBN38UBsm18jvPF7jEZPbxQGfqpoITsh1r2ZRBdEIAUg5uoobOoZ3vI5cHbZJ-OBbpWZXpwdRh8omRDLtLTU6J1KMx7znrdtZmYLy9\" alt=\"\" width=\"795\" height=\"447\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A few more enhancements to note:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We plan to require more employer profile fields during account creation\u2014notably, user phone number, public phone number, and public email<\/li><li>Employers will be able to share an <strong>institutional affiliation<\/strong>\u2014a school contact who can vouch for them if manual validation is required<ul><li>This can help you ensure that small, local employers you work with closely are able to get started on Handshake&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trust &amp; Safety Advisory Board was very enthusiastic about the potential impact of these changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;Thanks for the time savings that this represents for our team.
