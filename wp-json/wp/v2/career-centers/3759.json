These reminders are also outlined in the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1X128SeES9n9bQzTInTUJkfvAbgDEconBxSAn-_t0W8c\/edit?disco=AAAAJzUW-18&amp;ts=5ef26e20&amp;usp_dm=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Student Invite Email Templates<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360049934274-Virtual-Fairs-Student-Experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake\u2019s Guide to Attending a Virtual Fair<\/a> that you can send directly to your students.

Students will have a view of their fair schedule and be able to browse open sessions.<\/li><li><strong>Include information on signing up in all student emails. <\/strong>Share this <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/articles\/360051394454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">help article<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EzxrtLPW-Vw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this video <\/a>that walk students through the signup process.<\/li><li><strong>Encourage employers to message students ahead of time.<\/strong> Students are more likely to sign up for a particular session when they hear directly from the employer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake will help you drive student sign ups with popup notifications that appear after students register for the overall fair directing them to sign up for sessions. We will also send <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360052073953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">system-generated reminder emails<\/a> and push notifications to registered students two days before the fair and the morning of to promote session signups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><strong>Aim to have 50% of registered students signed up for an employer session one week before the fair.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2>2) Remind students to update their Handshake profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers have the option to set student qualifications for their 1:1 sessions. Currently about 50% of employers use qualifications for 1:1s. To ensure students qualify for these sessions,<strong> make sure they fill out the following fields on their profile:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>School year, major and GPA, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/227140787-How-to-Edit-Education-Information-on-Your-Profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">which can be found on their profile<\/a><\/li><li><strong>Work authorization status,<\/strong> which can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115015978207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy &amp; Settings page<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student leaves one of these fields blank, they will not be able to register for a 1:1 session where that field is used as a qualification. For work authorization, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115015978207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students have the option to decline to answer.<\/a> Doing so will allow students to qualify for 1:1s requiring work authorization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August 2020, we\u2019ll release updates allowing your team to see which 1:1 sessions have qualifications. If an employer is seeing low 1:1 session sign ups, you can recommend they can relax their qualifications. Reminder: group sessions are open to all attendees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3) Students should double check their technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remind students that it\u2019s a good idea to double check their technology before a virtual event.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To participate in virtual fairs, all students will need a reliable internet connection, speakers and microphone, and a supported device. Students who wish to use their video will need a webcam. Students will be able to join a session five minutes early to test their connection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a
