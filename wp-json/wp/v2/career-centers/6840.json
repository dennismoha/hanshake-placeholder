Having hosted several successful fairs in the fall, Sheri is back with more recommendations. If you\u2019ve reviewed Sheri\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/how-to-staff-a-virtual-fair\/\">original blog post on how to staff a virtual fair<\/a>, check out her tips below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Student Practice Fair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To help students get acclimated with the virtual fair experience, Sheri\u2019s team is hosting a practice fair before the actual event. Consisting of three group sessions, the practice fair will give students the opportunity to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get comfortable building a schedule<\/li><li>Test their audio and video setup<\/li><li>Use in-session features like raised hand and screen sharing<\/li><li>Get tips from the career center about virtual professionalism<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips for communicating with employers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Send at least one email to employers directly from your email address.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This ensures the message is less likely to go to spam or be overlooked. It also gives employers a direct email they can reach out to with questions. Sheri recommends doing this for a \u201clast minute tips\u201d email right before the fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Add employer attendees directly to the calendar invite for your Zoom\/help room.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We all live by our calendars now more than ever. Employers know you mean business when they see that multi-hour block on their calendars. This approach led to higher attendance in the employer help room, even just for last minute tips or to check-in with our team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fair staffing roles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to 5-8 team members joining the student and employer Zoom\/help rooms, Sheri\u2019s team has created two additional roles for the day of the virtual fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technical Expert<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One staff member in the Zoom\/help room focuses specifically on technical questions. Handshake\u2019s technical guides for <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360051037914\">students<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360051802973-Handshake-Video-Requirements-Troubleshooting-Employers-\">employers<\/a> are key assets for this person. The team uses Zoom\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jbPpdyn16sY&amp;feature=emb_title\">\u2018open\/self-select\u2019 breakout rooms<\/a> to allow this person to handle questions separately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No-Show Monitor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No shows are often individuals running late or having technical issues. This person monitors the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360053520554\">session details page<\/a> and connects with student and employer no-shows to provide assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Students no-shows<\/strong> are emailed asking if they need technical help and referring them to the student Zoom\/help room. They are reminded that, if they do not plan to attend, they are subject to the school\u2019s no-show policy and should unregister for the session to open time for other students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Employer no-shows <\/strong>are also emailed asking if they need technical help and referring them to the employer Zoom\/help room. The lead recruiter at the company in question is notified if the recruiter continues missing sessions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: Employers using an external video platform to host sessions will appear as a no-show on the session details page. This is because they are joining the session outside of Handshake. You can identify these sessions by looking for a link icon next to the registrant count. Clicking on the link icon will copy the external meeting link to your clipboard.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/d5jGc37f4I1vtv5ZAPvS5OcMBAiZVoW5O1166pYN9NZYUgOLdSjSERFk2r7gGLDE6GYk_NSDY9j71z_qRXYOLW4EC5A3tBNwhIWuP2JW-4TaWPK_pl9qveQ4Q6gzgTfLS2Tk_9Hz\" alt=\"How to staff a virtual fair\"\/><figcaption>Use the link icon to identify sessions hosted outside of Handshake.
