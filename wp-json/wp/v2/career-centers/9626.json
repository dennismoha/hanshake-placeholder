Similar to attending events with employers, some students may hit barriers related to confidence around stopping by the career center in person for an appointment. Others might find it hard to make the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many students will be eager to engage with your teams in person, a year of being virtual necessitates flexibility. Meeting students where they are\u2014whether in-person or virtual\u2014can help you reach a more diverse population and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/dei-report-templates-student-engagement\/\">close engagement gaps<\/a> across gender, race, and ethnicity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While virtual appointments have been offered at many schools in the past, Handshake is here to make the process even easier. We want our partners to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/employers-weigh-in-is-virtual-recruiting-here-to-stay\/\">thrive in a virtual-first fall<\/a>. That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching virtual appointments on Handshake, with seamless, integrated video (that you\u2019ll recognize from <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/virtual-fairs-this-fall-and-beyond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual fairs<\/a>), to help schools reach more students\u2014<strong>for<\/strong> <strong>free<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How will virtual appointments work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Career Services Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools offering virtual appointments through Handshake have historically had to spend time manually generating virtual meeting links from external platforms and shoehorning them into appointment fields. Virtual appointments on Handshake are a breeze to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This summer, we\u2019ll launch a new \u201cVirtual on Handshake\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/219132837\">appointment medium<\/a> that you can add to your existing <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/218693168\">appointment blocks<\/a>. It\u2019ll also be included in any new appointment blocks you create by default. Each advisor will have the flexibility to offer virtual appointments when they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/UYlFE0vrP-dU4eDe5hezHbmKKwItY066zwML7Z6dl-i5FkSvQVE6Ywj_1vwnkA74478o11Os5MEUa7M67YfWzeuMGnMVwQmCOZEhnrwKB-ZDx-1ZV9ffFUjiaBIQklJUIRMZUN8R\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption><em>Design subject to change<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Including \u201cVirtual on Handshake\u201d and a physical location as mediums on the same appointment block allows you to offer a hybrid of virtual and in-person appointments to students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to start the appointment, you\u2019ll see a \u201cStart Video Appointment\u201d button in the same place where you see the \u201cAppointment Started\u201d button today.
