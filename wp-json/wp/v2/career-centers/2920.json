With the shift towards a virtual fall, creating virtual career fair functionality and robust support has become a top priority. Many of our higher ed partners not only need to know details around how they can host a virtual career fair on Handshake, but what support will look like for preparation, day-of, and after these fairs as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because institutions of higher ed are the hub for career fairs and the heart of the Handshake network, we are optimizing for <strong>day-of support <\/strong>to ensure hosting your virtual career fair goes smoothly and your employers and students get help whenever needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Proactive Support for Hosting Virtual Fairs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with all other Handshake support arrangements, we\u2019re here to provide both <strong>proactive training and support <\/strong>and <strong>day-of support <\/strong>for escalated situations as you host your virtual career fair. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In advance of your fair, your Relationship Manager will proactively contact you to advise and guide your virtual fair strategy and operations, and ensure you feel confident in your fair configuration, preparation, and plan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we have a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/career-centers\/virtual-fair-launch-kit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual Fair Launch Kit <\/a>with a variety of resources and Help Center content showing how higher ed partners, employers, and students can prepare for and utilize Handshake virtual fairs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Day-of Support for Hosting Virtual Fairs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Support for Higher Ed Partners:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of proactive fair planning, we ask that our higher ed partners create, configure, and manage their own virtual fairs, as well as provide day-of support to their employers and students (more advice on <em>how<\/em> to do that is <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/advice-from-a-support-professional-on-staffing-your-virtual-career-fair\/(opens in a new tab)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in this blog post<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your team is unable to answer questions or resolve issues, they can escalate their questions to Handshake Support.
