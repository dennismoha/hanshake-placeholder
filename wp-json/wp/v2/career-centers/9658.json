National polling has highlighted how Americans have, in a relatively short time, become less confident about the value of higher education: according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/education\/272228\/half-consider-college-education-important.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey conducted by Gallup in 2019<\/a>, just over half (51 percent) of Americans believed a college education was \u201cvery important\u201d, a <em>19 point decrease<\/em> from 70 percent of U.S. adults in 2013.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar focus on value has emerged in the policy and practitioner world: the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s<em> <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.postsecondaryvalue.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/PVC-Final-Report-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Postsecondary Value Commission<\/em><\/a><em> <\/em>found \u201cinterest in defining postsecondary value has never been greater\u201d, with the COVID-19 pandemic \u201cdeepen[ing] the public\u2019s scrutiny of issues related to college value\u201d.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Overwhelmingly, students believe that higher education has played an important role in career preparation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>9 out of 10 students surveyed believed that higher education <em>played an important role in preparing them for their future career<\/em>. In contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/virtual-recruiting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">our findings<\/a> that students of color and women prefer virtual recruiting, this <em>did not meaningfully differ <\/em>across gender or race\/ethnicity subgroups and represents one of the only areas in our question set where there was widespread consensus.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/hWm1j6WiTCWSH-8m7MLHBL4Zb7E66j8RPJsTPwvcVcH40E46IkliKgv7wdO9thE_2ccGOiabOZpch48BwLEe-7H4xw7CEQprPaMFpSgsPaRngmEei7fvNDbDeHAAshzSW3PNV6q5\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importantly, this response reflects the sentiments of students who had experienced <\/strong><strong><em>over a year<\/em><\/strong><strong> of disrupted education. <\/strong>While 92 percent of students agreed that higher education played an important role in their career preparation, they also indicated a heightened level of stress associated with the job search: <em>almost two-thirds<\/em> of students stated that COVID-19 <em>made the job search more stressful<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, these results suggest that <strong>students may not associate the difficulties of the job search with the overall importance higher education has played in their career.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, these results provide additional evidence that some of the early, worst case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/article\/why-doomsday-hasnt-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cdoomsday scenarios\u201d<\/a> (in which colleges and universities would be unable to fully support students) had not come to pass, speaking to the resilience of both students and institutions of higher education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A majority of students believe higher education is \u201cworth the cost\u201d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Almost two-thirds of students surveyed (63 percent) agreed that higher education is \u201cworth the cost\u201d to students. <\/strong>This held across all groups, though notably,<em> <\/em>the response here was less unified than the previous question covering career preparation: 17 percent of respondents \u201cdid not agree or disagree\u201d that higher education was worth the cost, while the remaining 20 percent did not agree with the statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/92PLMKOHdMKZASPHIf9yyGBzCxK4almQgQGIYWcSK3CkRqEhAlm2R-EpP779Z5vaykrF6GSKxpVC4iEJYc6AU2m9oVvzxH98nHxHi7ApkqWbPVOrn899JE3qDGZp8Q8Mm-8ez7Xv\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher education stakeholders were also surveyed and asked whether they believed that current students viewed their higher education experience as \u201cworth the cost\u201d: 51 percent thought students would say it was worth the cost, <em>12 percent points lower<\/em> than students surveyed. This misalignment demonstrates a potential misreading of student resilience, though this figure is consistent with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newamerica.org\/education-policy\/edcentral\/higher-ed-tracking-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">national New America survey<\/a> of students from August 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, defining whether higher education is \u201cworth the cost\u201d is highly complex due to the diverse pathways students may take toward a credential, as well as the different levels of access to grants and other financial support. Nevertheless, the response is striking given the cohort\u2019s experience during COVID-19.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Postsecondary Value Commission\u2019s <em>Equitable Value<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postsecondaryvalue.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/PVC-Final-Report-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report<\/a> posits that college and university students experience value by gaining the \u201cknowledge, skills, and networks needed to be successful in work and life\u201d. Our results indicate that the cohort of college and university students whose educational journeys were directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic <em>still believe<\/em> that they received important preparation for their career. Furthermore, the majority of students still see higher education as worth the cost, exceeding the expectations of higher education professionals.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these results, it is also important to note the large number of students who were impacted throughout the pandemic: as a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/nscresearchcenter.org\/current-term-enrollment-estimates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Student Clearinghouse report<\/a> shows, undergraduate enrollment dropped nearly 5 percent this past spring over last year.\u00a0<br>As institutions, employers, students, and families consider what the \u201cnew normal\u201d looks like, it will be more important than ever to think about how institutions can deliver value to all students. One way to do this will be to build on the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/network-trends\/virtual-recruiting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">findings on virtual recruiting and equity<\/a>: <strong>by providing students with varied points of entry to networks and opportunities, institutions can create a more flexible and less intimidating environment for students to engage and pursue career opportunities.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student perceptions on the value higher education brings to their careers<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034983,"featured_media":9660,"menu_order":0,"template":"","career_centers_category":[1417],"career_centers_tag":[1697,1696,1698],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Is college worth it? | Handshake<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Findings from Handshake\u2019s network underscore a continued belief in the value of higher education.
