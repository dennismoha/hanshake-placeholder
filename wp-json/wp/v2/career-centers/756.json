Good question. We see it as a combination of factors. The recent decrease in stigma \u2014 and increase in acceptance \u2014 surrounding mental health has sparked more conversations on how individuals can take better self-care both at home and at work. Today\u2019s students want to work for a company that is inclusive and supportive of all aspects of their growth and development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lovellcorporation.com\/\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/The2017ChangeGenerationReport-Lovell-Corp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research<\/a>&nbsp;by Lovell Corporation, Gen-Zers are more likely to gravitate towards mental health support in a professional environment.
