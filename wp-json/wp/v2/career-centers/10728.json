Read on to learn how those refined recommendations appear in Handshake. Plus, get tips on how students can get the most out of their job search on Handshake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does Handshake improve to meet a student\u2019s preferences over time?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the first time students see a recommendation from Handshake to the point where they\u2019re superusers of our platform, they\u2019ve helped us better understand what they\u2019re looking for. Here\u2019s how students\u2019 actions in Handshake influence recommendations over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our initial batch of job recommendations are powered by a student\u2019s major and school year. We encourage students to log into Handshake for the first time using these recommendations in our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360052319913\">activation email campaigns<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/NoBp1vr36KAqkvvTkrACDqJ8efeJmAENWNN0wzeRFs1m4l2aG2ACB2KSm5mxudJ4UJYRVr-jLuOTFE1CyJ2OgAcytT483yqLtaI_nd_2TpMkKl3Xa_xTJIqG_BCPvIXWucJtrwVW=s0\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"504\"\/><figcaption>Example of an activation email featuring major-based job recommendations<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, if a student logs into Handshake and doesn\u2019t share their career interests, they\u2019ll see major and school year based recommendations in Handshake too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student does share career interests\u2014specifically job type, job role, location\u2014we\u2019ll layer in recommended opportunities based on that data. Similarly, we\u2019ll pivot to job recommendations based on <em>inferred<\/em> career interests if we notice the interests the student entered seem to have gone stale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We encourage students to browse these recommendations via <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360034996994\">digest emails<\/a> and more targeted job collections on the homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/oDA8yWvfMBlBQ9VuJFMs1xMpfXFfxXIo3PFZoh_2DjHSKgaE8VayllPi8cjlEFnsKPhcrRAY4jBoGJVC6ykmyBAkffmyHG6apf5ZIu8llVTMlSOEeV0TP3l3l81IKT1qQg8kSDU3=s0\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Example of a homepage job collection based on job role interests<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Handshake is putting additional emphasis on opportunities for students to foster a relationship with relevant employers. We recently rolled out virtual info chats, which allow all employers to offer 15-minute slots to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4405345596951\">connect virtually with students via job postings<\/a>. Employers can also opt to let students <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4405345251479\">message them about a position<\/a> when posting a job. We\u2019ll recommend relevant jobs in even more places if the employer takes advantage of these features and offers to connect with students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/HsV7GkCAPAKSB5eghhgbdfi-TQtK5dlPdGh4vcQM3nbi1ebLCqPT4ZQN0N45--XISN1FLdsUquR0MyO8EIPFw79_ew1QOEAuSBqVw8aaZqz7tk3pOqXvXUaE2BABCT6bZ7_KMByN=s0\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"524\"\/><figcaption>Mockup of a virtual info chat highlighted on the mobile app<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can students get the most out of their job search on Handshake?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We perform regular research to monitor how students search for jobs on Handshake and update our product to better accommodate them. Generally, students fall into two groups\u2014those who know what types of opportunities they\u2019re looking for and those who don\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handshake has recommendations waiting for students who just want to browse jobs.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many students log into Handshake without a strong sense of what they\u2019re looking for. Most will start their journey by navigating to the job search page and scrolling through the list of results without applying any filters or keywords. In the last six months, 45% of job search sessions included no filters or keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing this, we ensure that <strong>the first ~50 jobs that appear on the job search page (before you add any filters or keywords) reflect our best recommendations <\/strong>at the time. If a student is struggling to articulate what they\u2019re looking for, scrolling through that list is a great place to start. As they begin to engage with jobs\u2014viewing, favoriting, applying\u2014Handshake\u2019s recommendations will adapt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Students who know what they\u2019re looking for should employ filters and keywords strategically.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Students who have a sense of what they\u2019re looking for should first update their career interests. Any information they can provide will strengthen the recommendations Handshake makes. From there, the first 50 jobs on the job search page are still a great place to start browsing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student chooses to use a keyword or filters on the job search page, it\u2019s important to note:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Start with job type and location filters<\/strong>\u2014while it might be tempting to use employer preference filters to see which jobs you\u2019re fully qualified for (based on major, GPA, and more), employer preferences aren\u2019t always the best indicator of fit. They could be too narrow, too broad, or even non-existent.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Add a suggested job role filter<\/strong>, or choose one yourself\u2014Handshake suggests the most relevant job roles, based on what the system knows about your preferences.<\/li><li><strong>Use as specific a keyword as possible<\/strong>\u2014opt for a job title you know you\u2019re interested in, or a word you see regularly in relevant job descriptions.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last six months, 45% of job search sessions included filters, 22% included keywords, and 14% included both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that students generally understand how to get more relevant recommendations on Handshake. In a recent round of research interviews, students that saw an irrelevant job shared they weren\u2019t discouraged by it. Rather, they understood that it likely appeared because of a preference they shared or the search criteria they used. Upon realizing it wasn\u2019t what they wanted, they moved on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other platforms that serve up recommendations, students are comfortable with tools like Handshake learning from what they engage with. On our end, we\u2019ll keep working to make our recommendations stronger and stronger so that students can hit the ground running even faster.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Handshake\u2019s job recommendations get smarter the more you use the platform\u2014here\u2019s how students can take
