We created a website for on-campus employers that described step-by-step instructions to post a job, then offered open sessions to demonstrate the process and answer questions.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlighting Key Employers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After launching Handshake, the Kenyon team began using <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360008403834-Targeted-Email-Creating-and-Sending\">Handshake\u2019s Targeted Emails tool<\/a> to promote jobs, events, appointment scheduling, and more to students.&nbsp; In a particularly savvy move, the team has been giving their students an upper hand in sifting through opportunities (and to educating them on the best ways to look for opportunities on Handshake) by sharing links to pre-filtered job searches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they approve incoming requests from employers to connect, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360006639854\">applies a public label<\/a> to those employers with a close relationship to Kenyon.&nbsp; This public label is visible to students and helps them identify companies where a Kenyon alum works or that regularly recruit large numbers of Kenyon students.&nbsp; This label is also available to students as a filter on the job search page. By logging into their <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/219132677\">test student accounts<\/a>, the team was able to run a job search as a student with that filter applied\u2014the URL of the results page can then be shared directly with students to show them the same list of opportunities.&nbsp; Any Kenyon student who clicks on the link is immediately taken to the job search page with the label pre-applied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee shares that these emails led to a huge increase in student engagement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cStudents love the public facing label to identify jobs and internships from Kenyon alumni, parents and partners. It&#8217;s an easy way to both showcase these great opportunities to students and boost application numbers for these employers.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Student Engagement Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After just a few months of using Handshake, over 59% of Kenyon students have logged on, including over 55% of the freshman class.&nbsp; Furthermore, over 30% of their students have already completed their profiles. Both of these metrics represent feats that can take years to accomplish!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about his advice for a successful launch, Lee shared:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cDon&#8217;t rush implementation, and ask for help when you get stuck. There are many ways to get support: talk to Handshake, visit the community forums, or reach out to another partner institution that is willing to help, like Kenyon!\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how Kenyon drove almost 60% of their students to log into Handshake within three months of
