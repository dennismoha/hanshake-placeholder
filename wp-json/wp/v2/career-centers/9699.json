Institutions large and small shared that pooling resources helped them attract more employers and better serve students in niche majors. <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/multi-school-virtual-fairs-on-handshake\/(opens in a new tab)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hear more from your peers about the value of hosting a multi-school fair here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having helped facilitate countless multi-school virtual fairs this past year, Handshake\u2019s relationship managers shared the following tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Get creative with the focus of your fair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-school fairs work great for students of all majors and backgrounds. That said, joining forces with other institutions means you can attract more niche employers that are suited for students in a unique field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last year, we\u2019ve seen multi-school fairs targeting students interested in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Opportunities that require fluency in French<\/li><li>Employers in government, library, archive, and museum fields<\/li><li>Careers in boutique consulting<\/li><li>Jobs in marketing, PR, and advertising<\/li><li>And more!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since virtual fairs on Handshake are <strong>free<\/strong> for our partners to use, we encourage you to consider hosting multiple niche multi-school fairs to offer your students a more tailored experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Meet with your co-hosts regularly<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coordinating a fair across multiple teams can be challenging. The most successful multi-school fairs hosted over the last year saw participating institutions meeting regularly. Important topics to stay on top of include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Marketing the fair to students<\/li><li>Engaging each school\u2019s employer network<\/li><li>Day-of logistics and responsibilities<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After the fair is over, we recommend meeting again to discuss how the event went. This can help you identify best practices for your next fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Invite institutions that don\u2019t partner with Handshake to your multi-school virtual fair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An institution doesn\u2019t have to partner with Handshake to participate in your multi-school virtual fair. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/219132937#h_01EY8YDV9CX2577MY75BPSBXWF\">This help article<\/a> describes how you can make your fair invite only and then share it with your co-host schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Make sure each co-host promotes their school-specific link<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each co-host school will see a \u201cStudent Preview Link\u201d on the fair page in Handshake. This link is unique per school\u2014the URL starts with your school domain (e.g. \u201cjvu.joinhandshake.com\u201d). Make sure you use your school\u2019s unique link\u2014it\u2019ll lead your students to your unique login page. This ensures your students can easily log into Handshake and register.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>NOTE: If you\u2019re sharing the fair link with a non-partner school, update the fair link so that it begins with \u201capp.joinhandshake.com\u201d. This leads to Handshake\u2019s generic login page where non-partner students can sign up for an account and register for the fair.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Host a joint support room<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This summer, Handshake will allow schools to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360053511833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">add a button to the fair page to promote support rooms for students and employers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When hosting a multi-school virtual fair, we recommend joining forces and offering one support room for students and one for employers. We recommend you open your support rooms an hour before the fair. Historically, this is when schools have seen the most activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interested in partnering on a multi-school virtual fair?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake is compiling a directory of institutions seeking partners to host a multi-school fair.
