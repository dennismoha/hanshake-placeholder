They hold vast product and career services expertise and can offer schools insights and best practices for streamlining workflows and boosting student and employer engagement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Wendy Davis, Office Manager of Career Services and Employer Relations at Framingham State University, building a strong partnership with her Relationship Manager has been one of the highlights of her experience with Handshake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve found that Alex [FSU\u2019s Relationship Manager] is the key to being successful and understanding how to get from point A to point B. His product knowledge and his ability to help me find solutions has made everything so much easier and better.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Wendy believes that every school can benefit from building a partnership with their Relationship Manager. Here are her tips for getting started.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach out!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, your Relationship Manager\u2019s job is to help you unlock the full potential of Handshake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to figure out everything on your own,\u201d Wendy says. \u201cUse your Relationship Manger\u2019s help to determine if there are more things that you could or should be doing to enhance the success of Handshake at your school. They can bring you the resources and insights to expedite your work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m at a small school, and I could get lost in so many cracks. My Relationship Manager is like a calming force who supports me in all my Handshake endeavors. Even when my questions or needs seem like I should already know or have the answers, he\u2019s so vested in my success, he really makes me feel like I\u2019m a priority.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Align your expectations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSet parameters with your Relationship Manager on when it\u2019s most appropriate for you to go directly to them,\u201d Wendy advises. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some questions, it might be easier to find answers through the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Help Center<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Career Center Blog<\/a>. You can also tap into the experiences of your fellow career educators by chatting in the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake Community<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I run into a problem, I first think whether I can find the solution myself. Handshake does really well in terms of having other resources like the Help Center. My Relationship Manager is like an extra bonus. When something is super time sensitive, I know I can email him and get a timely response.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By working with their Relationship Manager, Wendy says, any school can grow their success on Handshake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWith Alex\u2019s [my Relationship Manager] support, I feel that we can grow anything \u2014 employers, events, student engagement. When you\u2019ve got such a resource that can make your life using Handshake easier, it\u2019d be crazy not to use that!\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h6>Have a Handshake story you want to
