One particularly important piece of data shared in the &#8220;key profile fields&#8221; blog post is that <strong>80% of students who share their job type, job role, and location preferences get a proactive message from an employer on Handshake<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in the number of students who are interested in gig or part-time work, the crisis hasn\u2019t meaningfully changed students\u2019 long-term hopes and plans. <strong>For example, while 61% of surveyed students were willing to relocate for their first job out of college before the crisis, 58% maintain that position today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, there are still many who are opting to continue their education over pursuing full time work: &nbsp;<strong>57.6% of students surveyed<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>said they are considering applying for graduate school instead of pursuing a job or internship.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Key Employer Trends<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h3>Impact on hiring depends on the industry<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our research with employers unearthed sharp differences in impact by industry.&nbsp; While a majority of employers report they\u2019re still evaluating changes to their hiring plans, we\u2019re already beginning to see trends in job postings emerge\u2014while some industries are seeing a significant reduction, others remain relatively steady by comparison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Y7TN-H_l6eVHm2Qlaz0yix_A6-8rL3NdkBKBGGgQoK4LrzEGA9we27Ui3jB1XUGuIdoIriDIqEzroFz_MK6P-1IFMDiN8d_VX-S0wudF6kr2IKAR7rGzAmAfr5gwZfwIeeexHerw\" alt=\"Most and least impacted industries\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, while we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in fully remote job postings across the network, most employers expect their roles that were meant to be on-site to eventually remain on-site\u2014thus, they\u2019re not changing them to be listed as remote.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Employers are quickly shifting to virtual channels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While most employers report challenges in making the shift to virtual recruiting channels, the vast majority are making this change quickly so that they can continue to make connections with students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img

href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-impress-employers-at-virtual-events\/\">virtual events<\/a>, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we continue to see strong growth in employers using Handshake to message students proactively about opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/MPWxIl8gngil4-mOd0v_KCDTMQje5HrtP5G5IQrkCx207ZQ8FcoekIN6ZDFXvw_M_VkY0D5XCt6z0Y2WALuqIJE_T6VaKG9GoAC7VULcekK4MnmtEttxnQjawhrbsUWV6U3jx_wY\" alt=\"Increase in messaging on Handshake\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, <strong>we saw over one million messages sent to students in a single week for the first time<\/strong>, and the numbers continue to climb.&nbsp; This reinforces the importance of students filling out their Handshake profiles.&nbsp; That profile data\u2014work experiences, organizations, job role and location interests, coursework, and more are regularly used by employers to target their messages.&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-on-your-handshake-profile\/\">Read more about key profile fields students should be filling out here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full-time jobs and internships are still available<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re fielding questions about what kinds of jobs are available\u2014or just want to give students some intel\u2014please share that the <strong>top jobs roles being advertised since the beginning of March<\/strong> are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Software Developers &amp; Engineers<\/li><li>Business Analysts and Management Consultants<\/li><li>Accountants<\/li><li>Data Analysts<\/li><li>Customer Service Representatives<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if you want to demonstrate to students that opportunities and internships are still available, let them know that <strong>82% of all jobs and 52% of all internships being posted right now are for full-time positions.&nbsp;<\/strong>So, there&#8217;s still reason to stay positive and engage in your job and internship search!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We will continue to update this article as more data is
