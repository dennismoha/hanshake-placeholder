The subject line should clearly convey the content and benefit of the email. Think about why the reader should want to open it and create a subject line that you think best communicates this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, brevity is key. Subject lines should be 40 characters or less, or they will get cut off in students\u2019 inboxes. Emails with longer subject lines also tend to have lower open rates. If you have time, consider A\/B testing your subject lines. Split your recipient list in half and send each group a different version of the subject line. Then, compare the open rates of each email. This is a great way to understand the language that is most compelling to your students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personalize the greeting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Students are more likely to engage with an email that looks personalized. Handshake lets you insert <strong>variable fields <\/strong>into your emails so that you can include a student\u2019s preferred name in the email greeting (\u201cHi Brit,\u201d will perform better than \u201cHi there,\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make the call to action prominent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your \u201ccall to action\u201d (or CTA) is the main outcome you want to drive with your email.&nbsp; Typically, it\u2019s a student signing up for Handshake, registering for an event, or filling out a survey.&nbsp; Make sure your main CTA is near the top of your email. You\u2019ll see this referred to as keeping the CTA \u201cabove the fold\u201d.&nbsp; If the CTA appears lower in the email, students are more likely to stop reading before taking any action.<br><br>Consider repeating your call-to-action near the end of the email. For example, if you\u2019re asking students to register for Handshake via a button, you can include the ask again as hyperlinked text. It may feel redundant, but this increases the likelihood of a student taking the action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tailor your message&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails that are tailored to a specific audience and include curated content perform better than more general ones. On Handshake, you\u2019re required to use at least one filter when defining your recipient list\u2014and we recommend that you use more as applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to create multiple versions of the same email that has varying content based on the students\u2019 majors, school years, career interests, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DePaul University has seen success with high email open rates by segmenting their recipient lists based on student career communities. At a school of about 15,000 undergraduates, these segment groups vary from a few hundred to a few thousand students maximum. By doing this, they ensure their email content is relevant for their students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Include relevant links in your email signature<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your email signature provides an opportunity to promote a variety of relevant links. You can include your social channels, website, or Handshake login page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Rutgers University includes links on a small Handshake logo and a larger Handshake banner in their staff email signatures. In just one semester, students clicked on these links more than 1,000 times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learn from email performance&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake allows you to review a variety of performance metrics after you\u2019ve sent an email. We\u2019d recommend keeping an eye on the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>As you test out different email subject lines, keep an eye on <strong>email open rates<\/strong> to see which language is driving the highest initial engagement with students.<\/li><li>You can review <strong>click rates <\/strong>on each link you include in your emails.\u00a0 See which calls to action perform the best.<\/li><li>Most emailing resources will tell you that Tuesday through Thursdays are the best weekdays to send email.\u00a0 Given each school\u2019s unique student body, make sure you keep tabs on the <strong>day of the week<\/strong> and <strong>time of day <\/strong>that performs best.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check out Targeted Email templates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake has included email templates in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360008403834\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Targeted Emails<\/a>. When you\u2019re prompted to select an email layout, you\u2019ll see the option to select a Handshake Template on the right-hand side of the screen. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of templates include a \u201cWelcome Back to School\u201d email and one motivating students to download Handshake\u2019s mobile app. You can edit the content of these emails to tailor your message to each segment of students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Chat with your peers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.joinhandshake.com\/hc\/en-us\/community\/topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake\u2019s Community<\/a> is full of email tips and examples of marketing techniques that have worked best at a variety of campuses.
