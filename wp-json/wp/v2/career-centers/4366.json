Virtual fairs are a different type of event, and provide a different type of event experience. There are positives and negatives to both; just remember they are not the same thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ease of having the event run inside of Handshake was amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Create some kind of way (either by making yourself an employer registration within the fair or an external Zoom link) to be available and provide support to both students and employers. We found one of the things we missed the most was the lack of personal interaction our team is used to having with students and employers. This helped mitigate that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Selena Hart\u2014Recruiting Specialist @ The University of Texas at Austin<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UT Austin is a distributed campus with 15 college and school career centers, 8 of which are exclusive users of Handshake. We were the first to host our virtual fair in early August focused on work-study and part-time employers. The biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair was getting employers to create their schedule. This part is not as intuitive since traditional in-person fairs did not require advanced scheduling, and it took a handful of email reminders and two instructional office hours to get our number of created schedules up to about 75%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake was how easy it was for students to navigate. Our students are at a hectic time in their lives and being able to set their schedule to ensure they met with their desired employers was a huge win for them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A piece of advice I would give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake is to remember what is in your circle of control because this is a new environment for all of us. You may see lower numbers in student registrations and employers may not create their schedules, but that does not mean your fair isn\u2019t going to be a success!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Muge Tuna\u2014Associate Director of Employer Relations @ Kelley School of Business at Indiana University<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a very proactive employer relations team that is used to supporting our employer partners significantly. Our biggest challenge was not having access to the employer sessions. We had several employers asking to edit their sessions, add\/change representatives or move students from one representative\u2019s schedule to another. It was hard for us not to be able to answer those specific needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the feedback we received from our employer partners the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake is the ability to add customizable requirements for the prescheduled 1:1 sessions. This was especially important for the employers that are recruiting for more than one function or line of service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My piece of advice to my colleagues is to start communicating early and communicate often. Make a step by step action list for <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1_f4jEP4-VGB9HPCH9M8fJzgadfSbQYmTi2mMdWsWmSM\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/10O85E_Bw4ybRltF54eUFiSsZ45F1gdk2aoNI24xHg2M\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">employers<\/a> and encourage them to utilize the Handshake articles, training videos and office hours. Remarkably, this approach helped us host 4 virtual fairs successfully utilizing Handshake for 6875 1:1 sessions and 259 group sessions attended by 4509 students with 167 participating employers in September 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Melissa Scholten\u2014Director of Career Services @ Southwest Minnesota State University<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that employers were completely set-up in the fair. It was fairly intuitive, but employers do not receive notifications about session signups. We also had employers log in and stay logged in for students to &#8220;walk-up&#8221; to the fair. Lots of information was given by our team and Handshake, but it seemed there was more of a learning curve than we anticipated. We are preparing for our next fair now and will have a better idea of how to coach and educate employers and students. Timing was also difficult for students (it was the second day of classes) so we are hoping that the next fair is better suited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually attended our part-time fair as an employer and it was a really seamless integration and went really smooth. Our campus employers had great feedback with one department finally filling two (typically) empty work study positions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to peer institutions and try to learn as much as possible in advance. Really require\/encourage student pre-registration and follow-up so that sessions are filled. Have employers check their IT and make sure everything works on their end in advance.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Megan Hellmer\u2014Assistant Director of Cooperative Education @ Lakeland University<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair was the amount of follow up that we found was needed. Whether it was following up with employers to build their schedules, or following up with registered students to be sure that they were signing up for time slots, there was a great increase in communication from our office prior to the fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake has been the fact that it has greatly decreased the prep work needed to host a fair (no setting up tables this time!!) and it has also shown us some very quick results. We are able to have students complete group sessions, complete interviews, and receive offers all within a few hours of time\u2014sometimes even without leaving their dorm rooms!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the resources that Handshake provides!! (I felt the need to type that in all caps but thought that may be excessive haha). I was overseeing our employer communication prior to the day of the fair and being able to provide employers with step by step instructions, videos, screenshots, etc., that Handshake had already created saved me a large amount of time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Carolyn Sutphin\u2014Employer Engagement and Experience Coordinator @ Radford University<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our biggest challenge for the Part-Time Job Fair and our upcoming career fair was getting employers to put their schedules in so that students could sign up. It\u2019s also the same with students; they register for the career fair, but then don\u2019t remember or think about signing up for sessions. We have decided to add deadlines for employers to get their schedules in before the fair.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t say enough about all the resources and training provided by Handshake provided to Career Centers, Employers and Students. The support has been great from Handshake.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our employers really enjoyed us providing virtual office hours and doing mock career fairs before the fair. We have offered 2 mock career fairs so far and employers have commented that these have been very helpful to them in preparing for the fair. Also providing a Zoom Room during the career fair for students\/employers to join if they have questions or need assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Matt Belt\u2014Technology Support Analyst @ Appalachian State University<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was your biggest challenge in pulling off the virtual fair?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By far, our biggest challenge for a virtual fair was getting employers to create their sessions in advance so students could sign up for them. We had several employers wait until the day before or day of to create their schedules, which resulted in them meeting with fewer students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the best part of the virtual fair experience with Handshake?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the virtual fair experience&nbsp;is the ease and autonomy during the day of the fair. Since most of the work involves communications and prep-work prior to the fair, when the day of the event came, there was a lot less hassle and stress than compared to an in-person fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a school hosting an upcoming virtual fair on Handshake?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication is key to a successful virtual fair. We recommend reaching out to employers often to get them to set up their sessions in advance, as well as messaging students to sign up for these sessions and check back often as employers create their schedules.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We asked your career services peers to share a bit about their experience hosting a virtual fair on Handshake.
