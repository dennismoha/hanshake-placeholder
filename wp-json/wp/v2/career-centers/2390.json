In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be introducing a new way to bring the early talent recruiting network to life; read on for more information about our research to date and what we\u2019ve uncovered about the true value of the career fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>Join us on May 6th at 10am PT\/1pm ET for a behind-the-scenes look at our research and development on virtual fairs to date. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/865865813270234127\" target=\"_blank\">Register here<\/a>.)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Redefining how we connect the network<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWe understand that <span style=\"color:#ff1100\" class=\"has-inline-color\">replicating the exact fair experience is not possible.<\/span>\u201d <\/em><\/p><cite><em>Lee Hameroff, Assistant Director of Assessment and Technology, University of Connecticut<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>After hearing from the universities, employers, <em>and<\/em> students in our network about the desire for a better fair option, a strategic group of product leaders at Handshake mobilized to research what\u2019s needed\u2014and what\u2019s missing\u2014from the current environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two questions were at the heart of our research:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do we help employers and students differentiate themselves and build relationships where in-person interactions are limited?&nbsp;<\/li><li>How can we help universities redefine and optimize how they facilitate connections in the early talent network?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What did we hear from our network? The majority of our employer partners tell us they want a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for virtual events and recruiting, and consider virtual fairs to be a meaningful alternative to in-person career fairs. And while the eagerness to adopt virtual fairs is shared by universities, both parties find the current options for virtual fairs to be lacking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From students we uncovered a sense that fairs weren\u2019t always working all that well before. Universities already know about the basic limitations of a large, in-person gathering\u2014long lines, limited space, repetitive interactions\u2014but when we spoke to students in our network we heard more personal feedback.&nbsp; At best, career fairs often feel like a necessary burden to students\u2014at worst, they can feel alienating. With lots of competition to be noticed, students remarked it felt hard to be \u201cseen.\u201d Because we also know that career fairs aren\u2019t just for seniors seeking jobs; there\u2019s an important component of discovery for students earlier in their career journey who still want to make connections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known that <span style=\"color:#ff1100\" class=\"has-inline-color\">there have been improvements to be made to fairs for years.<\/span> We\u2019re excited to see how Handshake can make the experience for students even better, with more connections and intimate networking opportunities. We need this ASAP!&#8221; <\/em><\/p><cite><em>Jason Aldrich Ed.D., Asst. Dean, Strategic Partnerships, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University&nbsp;<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities have a chance to lead the network in a better direction. In-person fairs have always had a travel and logistics component that limits the number of employers a school can engage for a single event. Further, we know that if the event experience universities provide isn\u2019t accretive to employer brand and recruitment efforts, then they run the risk of losing their critical role as connectors in the network\u2014especially if employers go around the career center to reach students. And if students don\u2019t feel seen or see the value, they will be reluctant to show up and engage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New mediums demand that value be generated in a different way, and not just by attempting to digitize a flawed analog experience. The new value that we can provide\u2014impossible to create without the special network of universities, employers, and students within Handshake\u2014is at the forefront of our efforts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Uncovering the value at the heart of a career fair<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on our research with higher education partners, we\u2019ve uncovered three central values of a career fair:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Student opportunity, education, and exploration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent poll we conducted with our partners showed that <strong>52.8% of career center partners<\/strong> felt student education and exploration was the greatest value of the campus career fair. And, given how students at every stage of their career search might leverage a fair event as a way to make more casual, exploratory connections, we consider this value a central focus in our design.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, fairs provide great value by helping students learn about companies, opportunities, and options with a low commitment threshold. Employers are able to promote their brand next to potential competitors or other leading brands, while career centers benefit from the ability to provide many options to students at once, while also helping out smaller employers who might need an extra brand boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Recruiting<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same poll, <strong>33.5% of career center partners<\/strong> said that recruiting was the greatest value of the campus career fair. This might be the opportunity for employers to screen candidates, or for students to move to the next stage in the process by showing their personality alongside their qualifications. In addition to the tangible benefits for employers and students, career centers also rely on the ability to easily prove their value to campus stakeholders based on hiring outcomes from a single fair event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Revenue<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Though only <strong>10.4% of poll respondents <\/strong>said revenue was the greatest value of a career fair, we know this will remain a factor as university budgets inevitably tighten in the coming months (or years).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s our commitment to you: in the coming weeks and months we will be developing an alternative to the current virtual fair options\u2014not by replicating what came before, but by innovating the next generation of large-scale engagement in a single system for employers, universities, and students at <em>all<\/em> stages of their career journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One last reminder: join us on May 6th at 10am PT\/1pm ET for a behind-the-scenes look at our research and development on virtual
