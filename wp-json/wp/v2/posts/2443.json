It\u2019s important that schools take precautions and prioritize students\u2019 health, which could mean more online classes for the fall semester\/quarter. Even if students <em>do <\/em>return to campus in the autumn, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-covid-19-recruitment-trends-mean-for-students\/\" target=\"_blank\">Handshake research shows<\/a> that most employers will continue to prioritize <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/category\/get-hired-remotely\/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual recruitment<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, you have the summer to prepare for whatever fall may bring, so you can take steps to ensure any easy transition when it comes time to return to classes and land a job or internship offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can I prepare for a virtual fall?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some actionable steps, broken down week by week, to help you feel more comfortable leading up to your virtual fall job search:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 1: Relax and rejuvenate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time to unwind at the start of summer! The normalcy in your college career was turned upside down in the spring term. You probably miss your friends and feel stripped of some key experiences. If you want to take a week to celebrate being done with the term before diving back into the work, you should do so without guilt. So do it: go for a run, bake more banana bread, learn a TikTok dance\u2013we all cope differently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 2: Message your existing network<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re probably already talking with your professors, classmates, and friends online and over video calls. Now is also a good time to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-get-useful-career-advice-from-other-students\/\" target=\"_blank\">reach out to people<\/a> outside of your regular communication rotation, too! Check up on that TA from an old favorite class, or your manager from a past internship. We\u2019re all looking forward to human connection and contacts like these are&nbsp;bound to have valuable feedback on questions you may have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 3: Complete your Handshake profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take some time this week to log in to Handshake and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-on-your-handshake-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fill out your profile<\/a>. Students with profiles full of their information, achievements, and preferences are more likely to get messaged by recruiters. It\u2019s always great to get a message or two from recruiters in your inbox after they stumble upon your filled out profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 4: Contact your career center<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s ideal to utilize your college\u2019s career center to answer your burning questions about the future of your college career, and any other inquiries you might have. They could have tips for a potential <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/questions-to-ask-during-virtual-interview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual interview<\/a> or insight on <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/hiring-on-handshake-500\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">which companies are still hiring<\/a>. Because career center staff have so much practical knowledge for students and alums of their specific institutions, their resources are key when planning out your individual virtual fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 5: Research companies thoughtfully<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheltering in place&nbsp;can provide time to think about where you really want to go with your career. Mull over the advice you\u2019ve solicited from your network and career center and implement that into your research. Think about a company you admire for both mission and action\u2013maybe what you would gain in an internship or job there. This is a great time to read reviews from past interns or employees, and even reach out to<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-get-useful-career-advice-from-other-students\/\" target=\"_blank\"> connect with people who work there<\/a> (or in related fields) for advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 6: Organize your resume and cover letters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the information you\u2019ve gathered in previous weeks, start optimizing your resume for the companies that you want to work for. After you\u2019ve sorted out a clear resume, make a few changes depending on the role you\u2019re applying to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a list of your top employers and then craft personalized cover letters for each. Recruiters care about the specific interest you have in the organization, and why you want to work for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 7: Get a head start before classes begin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the previous weeks passed, you\u2019ve done an incredible job preparing assets to make your virtual fall a breeze. With your resume and profile prepped and polished, you can start scoping out virtual events, checking out new job listings, and applying for meaningful jobs and internships before classes begin again. It\u2019s great practice, and it will relieve the job hunt pressure during your first weeks back in class.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get a head start on your virtual fall recruitment season with this seven-step plan for success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034980,"featured_media":2560,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_anchor_podcast":"","jetpack_anchor_episode":"","jetpack_anchor_spotify_show":""},"categories":[1491],"tags":[1492,1490],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Start Preparing For Virtual Fall Recruitment This Summer<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Looking for tips to ease into the virtual fall semester?
