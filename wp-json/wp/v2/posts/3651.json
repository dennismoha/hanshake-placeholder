For students that benefit from more financial support, having work-study can set them up for success in college.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the best work-study jobs?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best work-study jobs allow students to maintain flexibility for studying and extracurricular activities while also fostering a sense of responsibility and schedule organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Six best work-study jobs for students:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Resident\/Community Assistants<\/li><li>Campus Ambassador<\/li><li>Teaching Assistant<\/li><li>Research Assistant<\/li><li>Library Attendant<\/li><li>Tutor<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>How much do work-study jobs pay\/pay an hour?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most work-study roles pay at least your state minimum wage! Depending on the position and the tasks, you might be paid more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How do I know if I\u2019m eligible for work-study?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out if you qualify for work-study, you first need to <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.gov\/h\/apply-for-aid\/fafsa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">submit an application to FAFSA<\/a> (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). After your application is processed, you will find out if you\u2019re eligible for work-study.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to find work-study jobs?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After you get approved for work-study at your individual college, you should get access to a job listing page with qualifying openings. Check your school\u2019s on-campus job listing page and read the job description to see if that certain job works for your situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I do for work-study?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When deciding what to do for work-study, consider the type of job that would work for your schedule. For example, if you live in the residence halls it might be convenient for you to be a resident assistant or work on campus. If you commute to school, maybe consider a work-study job that allows remote work or another location to work at. Most work-study jobs are located on campus, so consider if that is a pro or con for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consider the following questions when looking for a work-study job:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do I want an on-campus job?<\/li><li>Do I want my work-study job to set me up for a more serious job later?<\/li><li>How many hours a week can I commit to work-study?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to balance work-study with school?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Five tips for balancing work-study and school:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Try not to procrastinate\u2013do your projects in advance with time to spare<\/li><li>Communicate to your boss if you have tests or presentations in advance so you can take time off or get your shifts switched with someone else<\/li><li>Try and seek out a work-study job that relates to a passion of yours<\/li><li>Dedicate time for mental health and personal wellness\u2013without the pressures of school and work<\/li><li>Build a positive network of friends and colleagues to help you study and share struggles of being a college student<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>What jobs are work-study?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your individual university, there are many various types of jobs that are work-study. Check with your school\u2019s job listing page or <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">speak with career services<\/a> about your options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How many hours does a work-study job require?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Work-study jobs typically do not make students work more than 20 hours a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How do I get a work-study job?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve applied and been cleared for work-study, check with your university job listing page and begin applying to work-study jobs that pique your interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by <a
