It\u2019s always a good idea to mention that you have strong communication skills, know how to work with patients effectively, or have had experience collaborating with a cohort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What should I write in my cover letter?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Though you might be applying for an entry level nursing position, that doesn\u2019t mean that aren\u2019t others trying to secure the same job as you. It\u2019s important in your cover letter to stand out and really show what you can offer. Not only is it recommended that you list skills and experiences you\u2019ve had, but also the willingness to learn and adapt to the role. By letting the hiring manager know that you\u2019re motivated to get started, they might be more inclined to meet you in person and see if you\u2019re the right fit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-entry-level-job-cover-letter-that-will-get-you-noticed\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article with proper formatting techniques<\/a> and more in depth information about the perfect cover letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is it like to work in nursing?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other jobs that work with the public, nurses spend a majority of their time speaking with patients and conducting physicals and other treatments. Working in healthcare in a patient facing role is all about helping others and using all your knowledge and skills to assist their journey to being healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are some jobs for nurses?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in specialized nursing roles, consider these:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Academic Nurse Writer<\/li><li>Hospice Nurse<\/li><li>Dialysis Nurse<\/li><li>Nurse Midwife<\/li><li>Nurse Case Manager<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are some essential nursing skills?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some essential skills to have as a nurse:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Patience<\/li><li>Great communication skills<\/li><li>Knowledge of policies and procedures<\/li><li>Reliability\u00a0<\/li><li>Attention to detail<\/li><li>Training for your specialty\u00a0\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is travel nursing and what are the benefits of a travel nursing career?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tnaa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Travel nurses<\/a> are healthcare professionals that take short roles in hospitals, usually due to understaffing in said hospital.\u00a0 As a traveling nurse, you\u2019ll be able to see and work in different places with many different people. Not only will you be able to grow in your practice and knowledge, but also in your social understandings of other clinics or hospitals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Is it hard to get your first nursing job right after graduation?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The span of time from graduation to when you land your first nursing job can differ for everyone. A few steps can make the transition from school to full-time work a bit easier:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Organize your calendar around when you want to take the NCLEX and map out your study sessions accordingly<\/li><li>Start early and map out the places that you want to apply to<\/li><li>Write your cover letters out early and send to professors or mentors for edits<\/li><li>Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if it takes longer than you wanted<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Is becoming a registered nurse worth it?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other career paths, the road to becoming a registered nurse won\u2019t always be linear. However, once all those long hours studying and memorizing kick in, being a registered nurse will yield an abundance of benefits. With your certification you can apply to higher up jobs that you want, set yourself up for a successful career, and do it all while answering the call to save and help others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Research the job role, duties, and application tips for working as a
