Here are tips for following up after your virtual sessions with employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Follow them on Handshake<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you meet an employer you like, go to their Handshake page and click <strong>Follow<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll receive notifications when they post new jobs and events. Plus, when the employer views your profile, they can see that you follow them. Mutual interest definitely works in your favor!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apply to an open job or internship<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you\u2019re on their Handshake page, check out the list of open jobs and internships. If you discussed a specific opportunity with the employer, get ready to send your application. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn\u2019t discuss a specific job, read through what\u2019s available and apply to any that interest you. If you need a little time to get your application ready, save the job you like so you\u2019ll get a notification to apply before the deadline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Send a thank you email<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the employer shares their contact info, plan to send a follow-up email <strong>within 24 hours<\/strong> of your session. Begin your email by thanking them for their time and telling them you enjoyed meeting them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, include something specific that you liked discussing or learning about. Finally, let them know what next steps you\u2019re taking, such as applying for a job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick tips for your follow up:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Prepare a draft of your message before your sessions.<\/strong> That way, you can quickly edit and send them once the session is over. This will make it easier to get your email out quickly, and will help you stand out.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Keep the subject line&nbsp;simple. <\/strong>You can have \u201cThank you\u201d as your subject line or include your first and last name.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Be concise.<\/strong> Employers are busy and receive a lot of email, so keep your message brief. One or two short paragraphs is all you need.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Proofread before you click send. <\/strong>It\u2019s really important to catch any spelling or grammatical errors. If you have time, ask a friend or family member to review your message as well.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h6>Find more answers to common virtual event questions <a
