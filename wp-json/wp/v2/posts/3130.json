However, by following a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/prepare-for-virtual-recruitment-challenge\/\">few steps<\/a> and checking out <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/hiring-on-handshake-500\/\">companies that are hiring<\/a>, you can set yourself up for an easier application and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-make-a-good-impression-in-a-virtual-job-interview\/\">interview process<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/category\/student-stories\/\">Handshake student stories<\/a>, Hyun-Soo\u2019s began with a straightforward application process and a valuable internship experience that followed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhile I was a student, I worked multiple jobs and often had difficulty attending on-campus career fair events. However, Handshake allowed me to apply to jobs quickly and on my own time. The deadline notifications and reminders were particularly helpful.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As her spring 2019 semester at University of Michigan wrapped up, she embarked on her <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/investment-banks-hiring-now\/\">first summer internship at Deutsche Bank<\/a> as an analyst intern. Her internship allowed her to gain valuable skills and trade knowledge in a professional field that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-get-a-software-engineering-job-without-a-stem-degree\/\">wasn\u2019t directly related<\/a> to her organizational studies major.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Going virtual<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After her internship ended, Hyun-Soo began her final year at University of Michigan. However, like many others, during March of this year classes became remote\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/category\/get-hired-remotely\/\">shifting real life to online<\/a> and pushing students to come up with new ways to adapt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would say take a lot of study breaks and take a lot of time to just ground yourself in your environment,\u201d Hyun-Soo says when asked about <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-make-the-most-of-a-remote-internship\/\">succeeding in a remote environment<\/a>. \u201cYou\u2019re not in school so you may be working where you sleep.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even while adapting to the new status quo and focusing on graduating on time, Hyun-Soo also <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-turn-your-internship-into-full-time\/\">secured herself a full time job offer<\/a> at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Securing an offer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-wow-recruiters-that-message-you\/\">reaching back out to the recruiter<\/a> from her previous internship at <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/17420\">Deutsche Bank<\/a>, she notified the company of her interest and later was told that there was an open position for her. This fall Hyun-Soo will begin her journey as Corporate Banking Analyst, diving headfirst into new and exciting ways to grow her already blossoming career. Hyun-Soo\u2019s experience illustrates the importance of developing and cultivating relationships in addition to showcasing your skills, abilities and enthusiasm for learning as an intern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m really excited to learn about the financial industry and the kind of work I&#8217;ll be doing for the different stakeholders. I don&#8217;t necessarily have a strict finance background or the most experience in finance, so I&#8217;m just excited to learn more about a field that I didn&#8217;t get to learn as much about as I wanted to in school and explore a whole new industry,\u201d she says about her upcoming role.
