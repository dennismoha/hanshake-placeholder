Beset by the sunny disposition of college advisors, faculty, and peers, you manage to find your way into the first session of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s daunting!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a lengthy discourse. A tour around campus and a few academic sessions later, you almost forget you still need to enroll in your classes before nightfall. Still, you take a step back to reflect. A whole lot of \u201cnew\u201d just happened. You may have even learned that your once highly-sought-after major may not be the right one for you! You might feel lost, wondering if you\u2019re making the right decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, your relationship with academia is no longer just participation and performance, but a holistic approach toward your career. One that\u2019s atypical to the traditional, linear paths you anticipated. Taking the next step becomes a venture of its own, as each path can open several doors, but close just as many. In reality, the climate in career and academics is shifting. Your friends may be on the same boat as you. And that\u2019s when it hits you: you need someone to help you kickstart the career process. Someone with only one, impartial goal: to find you the right path to career success. Enter, career services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, what are Career Services? How can they help?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first step to career success is figuring out where your college career office lies. The chances are your college or university has developed this team of professionals, equipped with the knowledge and online tools necessary to help you find employment upon graduation. They may even introduce you to Handshake! Give the offices a visit. Career success begins early on in your academic career, knowing when to set the right career goals for timely completion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-percent-of-college-students-get-jobs-after-graduation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"While extremely valuable (opens in a new tab)\">While extremely valuable<\/a>, you\u2019ll still want to have as much leverage as possible to supplement your bachelor\u2019s degree; you may build networks, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"obtain shadowing and internship experiences (opens in a new tab)\">obtain shadowing and internship experiences<\/a>, attend seminars, or potentially even find a mentor. 61% of full-time entry level jobs now <a href=\"https:\/\/talent.works\/2018\/03\/28\/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-iii-61-of-entry-level-jobs-require-3-years-of-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"require at least 3 years of experience (opens in a new tab)\">require at least 3 years of experience<\/a>.
