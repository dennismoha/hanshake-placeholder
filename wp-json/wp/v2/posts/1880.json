But what if you could do it from the comfort of home? For many employers, virtual interviewing is the future\u2014whether you live far away or need to interview remotely for another reason, video conferencing is an easy fix that many companies utilize when meeting candidates \u201cface to face.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While video interviewing doesn\u2019t allow for <em>some<\/em> tried-and-true methods for making a good impression, like giving a firm handshake, there are many ways to wow your potential boss from behind a screen. Simply follow this guide to prep and perfect your video interview skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Prepare in advance&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to do your research on the employer ahead of time! <a href=\"http:\/\/app.handshake.com\/\">Log into Handshake<\/a> and check out their profile, read reviews from peers who\u2019ve worked or interned there, and scope out recent news coverage of the organization for developments. The better equipped you are to ask thoughtful questions, the smoother your conversation will go throughout the interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also use this time to review your resume and the job description, and consider how your past experience might help you exceed in the role. Having this information fresh in your mind will help you feel more confident during the video call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Show up on time&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the easiest ways to start things off on the right foot: show up on time! While you don\u2019t need to log on 15-minutes early like you would when arriving for an in-office interview, definitely enter the video chat promptly at the set start time. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, make sure that you\u2019ve got the correct software loaded (if necessary), and consider a test call with a trusted friend to work out any kinks in your connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dress for success, even remotely<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you look polished and professional \u2014 at least up top. (The beauty of video calls is that nobody will know if you wear sweatpants with your Oxford shirt and tie!) Consider a button-up shirt or blouse, and be sure to groom just as thoughtfully as you would for an in-person meeting. Not only will this help you make a great impression with your interviewer, but wearing clothes that make you feel confident will also help you get your head in the game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Think about your background<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably wouldn\u2019t invite your future boss over to your house if it were strewn with socks, right? So don\u2019t let them see that on video! Find a clean, quiet area of your living space where you can take the call. Be sure to speak with any housemates in advance to ensure that nobody will walk behind you or make loud noises while you\u2019re in the middle of discussing your professional strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Make \u201ceye contact\u201d with the camera<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If it helps, consider putting some googly eyes next to your webcam to remind you to look directly at it throughout the call. This gives the appearance of making eye contact, not distractedly staring at your screen! Making eye contact, even if through a laptop, helps foster a sense of genuine connection and attentiveness; it can make all the difference when trying to hit it off with your interviewer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Stay focused and visibly engaged&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to show your interviewer that you\u2019re motivated and engaged is by practicing active listening. Consider nodding your head to give affirmations of understanding while they talk, and asking clarifying questions when necessary. Also, take hand-written notes! Keep a notebook nearby so that you can jot down questions or key takeaways from the interview without having to disrupt the flow of the conversation with loud typing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t rely on a cheat sheet, but be prepared<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If relevant, be prepared to share your portfolio or examples of work to your interviewer; keep some tabs at the ready and offer to share your screen if the topic comes up. Also, come to the interview with questions that you\u2019d like to ask your interviewer. This shows initiative and genuine interest. (You can find some good examples for interview questions <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-answer-when-an-interviewer-asks-if-you-have-any-questions\/\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember to stay responsive after you wave goodbye<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you end your call, be sure not to \u201cghost\u201d your interviewer. Download the Handshake app to ensure that you respond to recruiter messages promptly, and check your email at least twice per day to stay abreast of any outreach or next steps that might land in your inbox!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you\u2019ll have all the keys to succeed in your video interview.
