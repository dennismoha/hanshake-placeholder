Not every entry-level job dons the notorious \u201cone to three years\u2019 experience\u201d requirement. Entry-level jobs <em>do <\/em>exist!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But what is considered entry-level?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In actuality, the definition is as fluid as you can imagine. It\u2019s the immediate level of employment that <strong>you<\/strong> are eligible for based on <strong>your <\/strong>education, skills, knowledge, abilities, and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">internship<\/a> experience. An entry-level position in the field of engineering and psychology will vary greatly in the breadth of aforementioned attributes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do I find one?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More entry-level positions are being offered to college graduates than ever. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-percent-of-college-students-get-jobs-after-graduation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">there\u2019s some credible data out there to prove it<\/a>, with <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/06\/30\/news\/economy\/college-grads-jobs\/\"><em>CNN Business<\/em> asserting<\/a> that new grads are taking a substantial share of the market\u2019s \u201cgood jobs.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start preparing for those seemingly-elusive, no-experience opportunities by&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using Handshake<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake exists as a collaboration with many <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">college career services centers<\/a> nationwide, with the sole purpose of connecting you with your next opportunity. If your college has one of these centers or <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/finding-your-career-advisor-could-mean-finding-your-career\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career advisors (opens in a new tab)\">career advisors<\/a>, then it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve already got your own account. Not yet? Sign up <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/\">here<\/a>! (All it takes is a \u201c.edu\u201d email address.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve activated your account, we\u2019ll ask you a few questions based on your major, interests, skills, etc. Be as detailed as possible, because we send all of our students custom-tailored notifications featuring exciting opportunities. You\u2019ll also want to create a detailed personal profile \u2014 you might just catch the attention of one of your local recruiters!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With everything set, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/find-a-job-using-handshakes-filter-functions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"use Handshake to search (opens in a new tab)\">use Handshake to search<\/a> thousands of opportunities, many requiring no work experience. You can easily spot one by looking at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Required education<\/strong>: Fight the temptation to apply for a position requiring only a high school diploma. You\u2019ll be considered overqualified, and it\u2019s not kosher when building your career path. Find the no-experience jobs that require just a bachelor\u2019s degree.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Years of experience<\/strong>: You might see anything ranging from one to three years, and that\u2019s okay! If you do have the \u201cintermediate Excel skills\u201d or \u201cCAD certification\u201d requirements met, you should still consider applying, especially since that required experience might come with a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-highest-paying-entry-level-jobs-in-top-industries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">higher pay<\/a> or leverage for salary negotiations. Those one to three years\u2019 worth of experience might also take your internship experience into account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can apply for any entry-level job on Handshake, assuming you qualify and meet the minimum requirements. The advantage of applying via Handshake? Only other students seeking entry level jobs can apply \u2014 keeping the competition leveled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consider an internship before pursuing entry level work<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancecareers.com\/what-are-the-best-entry-level-jobs-2059636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">a survey revealed<\/a> that 60% of interns were offered a job after their <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/considering-a-paid-internship-read-this-first\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">paid internship<\/a>.
