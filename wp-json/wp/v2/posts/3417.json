That\u2019s about $23,650 per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Where can I work as a cashier?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On the list of employers <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/hiring-on-handshake-500\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hiring on Handshake<\/a>, there are many companies hiring cashiers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc.<\/li><li>Comerica Bank<\/li><li>Wegmans Food Markets<\/li><li>99 Ranch Market<\/li><li>Publix Super Markets<\/li><li>Raising Canes<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other places to apply for \u201ccashier jobs near me\u201d in your city include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Grocery stores<\/li><li>Hardware stores<\/li><li>Restaurants<\/li><li>Banks<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I put on my resume?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many places hiring cashiers are looking for similar skill sets in <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-new-grad-resume-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resumes<\/a>, but what makes the right candidate are the specific skills you can offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>List your past experiences&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve never held a cashier position before, you definitely have skills from past experiences you can offer. From volunteer work to school projects that you did\u2013there are always skills you can pull from your life that apply. Because cashiering is an entry-level job, employers hiring cashiers just want to know that you know how to apply what you\u2019ve learned to the role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider listing some of these skills that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/3-ways-to-become-a-better-candidate-before-even-applying\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">might make you a better candidate<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Organization<\/li><li>Accountability for yourself and others<\/li><li>Punctuality<\/li><li>Thoughtful communication<\/li><li>Open to change and growth<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Technical skills<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If cashiering won\u2019t be your first role, then you may have some technical skills from previous jobs to add to your resume. It\u2019s always a good idea to mention that you might\u2019ve worked a register before, directly handled money, or have had experience working with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I write in my cover letter?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though you might be applying for an entry-level position, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t others trying to secure the same position as you. It\u2019s important in your cover letter to stand out and really show what you can offer as an employee. Not only is it recommended that you list skills and experiences you\u2019ve had, but also the willingness to learn and adapt to the role. By letting the hiring manager know that you\u2019re motivated to get started, they might be more inclined to meet you in person and see if you\u2019re the right fit.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-entry-level-job-cover-letter-that-will-get-you-noticed\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article with proper formatting techniques<\/a> and more in-depth information about the perfect cover letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is it like working as a cashier?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a cashier, you\u2019ll be surrounded by customers who might look to you for assistance. While you tend to the register or stock items, you\u2019ll also use your communication skills to help other coworkers or patrons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is the role of a cashier in a bank?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cashiers at banks are in charge of greeting customers, handling and tendering money, and other duties of the specific bank where they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is the hardest thing about being a cashier?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the environment you work in, you will be tasked with working with a wide variety of people. There might be a difficult customer one day, but the next it could be the complete opposite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What does a cashier job entail?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cashier job responsibilities can vary depending on the type of establishment where you are employed. General day-to-day tasks might be restocking items, ringing customers up, taking inventory, or cleaning up around the store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by <a aria-label=\"undefined
