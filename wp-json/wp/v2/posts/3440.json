You\u2019ve scoped out the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-great-companies-to-work-for-on-handshake\/\">attending employers<\/a>, registered for a few group and 1:1 sessions, and you\u2019re feeling excited about the connections you\u2019re about to make. You\u2019ve got your outfit picked out, you\u2019ve chatted with <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-college-roommates\/\">your roommates<\/a> about keeping quiet and avoiding distractions during the fair, and you\u2019re hopeful that you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-impress-employers-at-virtual-events\/\">make a good impression<\/a> and find the job or internship you\u2019re dreaming about. So, what else can you do <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/attending-a-virtual-career-fair-here-are-10-tips-you-need-to-know\/\">to prepare<\/a>? It&#8217;s time to work on your elevator pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things you can do ahead of any virtual event is to prepare a few talking points to succinctly make the case about why you\u2019re a great candidate. The employers that you meet with want to learn more about you! So think of a short overview about your background, studies, and career goals. Practice with a friend or family member ahead of the virtual fair so you\u2019re ready when it\u2019s time to introduce yourself to a recruiter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, read our tips for how to prepare an elevator pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an elevator pitch?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An elevator pitch is essentially your TL;DR\u2014it\u2019s a short and sweet synopsis about yourself for a prospective employer. It\u2019s called an elevator pitch because it\u2019s meant to be brief enough to deliver convincingly during a quick elevator ride to your floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long should my pitch be?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about the length of your average elevator ride. Not long, right? It\u2019s a best practice to keep your elevator pitch to a minute or less! The key to an impactful elevator pitch is to stay short and sweet, avoid rambling, and prioritize truly pertinent information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I include in my elevator pitch?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on the skills and qualifications that\u2019ll make you uniquely appealing to your audience. Give some top-level bullet points about what makes you an awesome candidate!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your field of study<\/li><li>A couple relevant skills or certifications<\/li><li>A nod to relevant experience&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your elevator pitch should also touch on your professional goals: if you hope to find a job at a mission-driven startup, or want to relocate to Denver, or aim for a role where you\u2019ll flex your coding skills, mention these.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to meet with a few different types of employers during your career fair, don\u2019t be afraid to tailor your pitch to different industries and roles. For example, your proficiency in Photoshop might not be relevant to a corporate sales role, but it is for marketing! Be aware of your audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to deliver an elevator pitch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to your elevator pitch, practice makes perfect. You might feel silly running through a 30-second spiel about yourself, but becoming confident in your delivery can make a huge difference when you\u2019re face-to-face with a recruiter! Aim for your pitch to be brief, persuasive, and confident\u2014not boastful. Ask a trusted friend or family member to run through your pitch with you a few times, give constructive feedback, and help you nail it!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How should I wrap up after my pitch?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, it\u2019s a best practice to have a business card or a copy of your resume to hand to somebody after delivering your IRL elevator pitch during a career fair. However, since you\u2019ll be meeting recruiters during virtual fairs, have a link to your Handshake profile handy to send via chat! If relevant, you can also share a digital portfolio during this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elevator pitch examples:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u201cI\u2019m Brinton and I just graduated UC Davis with a degree in English!
