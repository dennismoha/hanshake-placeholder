And while it might take a bit of extra effort to find friends and build a network while interning in a virtual format, there are plenty of ways for you to make connections as a remote intern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a few of the creative ways that <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/our-team\/meet-handshakes-all-virtual-summer-intern-class-of-2020\/\">Handshake\u2019s 2020 summer interns<\/a>, who are interning virtually from their homes across the country, have found to make connections during their months at Handshake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Set up quick virtual coffee breaks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In traditional in-office internships, there are often opportunities to meet new team members at the coffee machine, or on a quick jaunt out for lunch. Though it might take a bit more advance planning, try to replicate this same experience with teammates via video conferencing! At Handshake, interns are encouraged to participate in \u201cdonut chats\u201d with folks from around the company; these 20-minute hangouts take place over Zoom, and allow interns to get to know folks in different functions, departments, and parts of the world in a low-stakes way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your virtual internship, consider snagging a short slot on a different teammate\u2019s calendar every week to simply chat and get to know one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create a \u201cbreakout room\u201d&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s something special about getting work done alongside your peers, or having the freedom to hold an impromptu brainstorm session. If you\u2019re navigating a remote environment and know that other interns might feel similarly intimidated about making friends, try setting up a \u201cbreakout room\u201d for work sessions via video chat! Even if you all just sit in companionable silence while you type, or listen to the same playlist together while organizing spreadsheets, replicating the feeling of an in-office hangout can be a good way to become comfortable with your new team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Send personal follow-up chats<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all had those moments: somebody mentions that their weekend plans include watching a show you love, or visiting a location you\u2019re fond of. If this happens at the start of a meeting, though, it\u2019s not always an appropriate time to start a personal conversation with a new coworker. However, don\u2019t miss your chance to bond over a shared interest! Once your meeting is over, shoot them a chat to spark a discussion:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>\u201cHey, I heard you mention that you\u2019re binge-watching <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender<\/strong>. I love that show! Which type of bender would you want to be?\u201d<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>\u201cDid you say at the start of the meeting that you like to bake? I\u2019m looking for a new recipe to try this weekend! Any suggestions?\u201d<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>\u201cI noticed your Warriors hat during our team call! Are you more of a Klay Thompson fan or a Steph Curry enthusiast?\u201d<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While you don\u2019t want to distract somebody from their work for too long, these quick convos can be a great way to forge connections with new people over the course of your internship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want even more pointers for navigating life in a remote world, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joinhandshake\/\">follow our Instagram<\/a> for daily advice.
