But what does it mean to make a good first impression at work\u2014and how do you do it?  We&#8217;ve outlined a step-by-step guide for you to get your new job or internship off to a great start. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get enough sleep<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have received this advice when prepping for a big exam or event. Getting a good night\u2019s sleep will make all the difference in how you show up at work. You\u2019ll feel better, have more energy, and be able to concentrate. Appearing tired or sluggish at work won\u2019t be perceived well by your coworkers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dress appropriately<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to ask about the office dress code. Unless you\u2019re working in law or finance, you probably won\u2019t need to wear a suit. However, you should still have a neat and professional appearance\u2014especially when you\u2019re starting out. That means you should avoid anything that is meant for the gym, is ripped, or shows too much skin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay attention to what your coworkers and manager wear to help guide you. The same goes for remote work\u2014be sure to look pulled together on video. If you want to rock sweatpants, just make sure they\u2019re not visible when you\u2019re on camera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And remember, it\u2019s always better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be a little early (or at least on time)&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? Don\u2019t be late to work. Showing up a few minutes early, or right on time, shows your employer that you\u2019re dependable and responsible. And that\u2019s the impression you want to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set an alarm and give yourself plenty of time to get ready. Research your travel time if you\u2019re taking public transportation or driving. Then, add in a little extra time to account for any unforeseen delays or traffic. It\u2019s better to be early than late\u2014and you\u2019ll have time to get settled in and grab coffee before you start the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smile and make eye contact<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re meeting new coworkers, always smile and maintain eye contact as you&#8217;re speaking with them. This will help you appear friendly, and will give them have a good impression of you. Plus, a positive attitude is contagious\u2014so bring good vibes into the office!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introduce yourself&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be intimidating to be the \u201cnew person\u201d at work. But just remember that everyone at one point was the new person. Your manager may bring you around for introductions, but if not, take the initiative and introduce yourself to your team members. Be friendly, share a little bit about yourself, and tell them you look forward to working with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, be sure to say hello and meet other people in the office\u2014in the kitchen, before a meeting, or even waiting for the elevator. Whenever you come across a new face, be polite and introduce yourself. If you\u2019re not great at small talk, ask them if they have recommendations for a good lunch spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of any office networking or social events as well. Meeting other people and building connections will make all the difference in your work experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take initiative<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve accepted a new role, chances are you\u2019re excited about the opportunity. Be sure to show your team this enthusiasm when taking on new projects. If a coworker asks for your help on something, you should say yes\u2014as long as you have the bandwidth to help them and finish your own work. This will help you be seen as a team player\u2014and they\u2019ll likely be willing to help you in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to ask a lot of questions\u2014that\u2019s how you\u2019ll learn at a new job. Even after new-hire onboarding and training, you\u2019ll likely have to ask for clarification or guidance as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your coworkers probably aren\u2019t aware if they\u2019re leaving out information you need. They\u2019ll appreciate it when you ask questions, because it shows you want to learn and perform your job well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Listen and take notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Treat your first few weeks in a new job like a course at school. Taking notes is the best way to remember the deluge of information you\u2019ll receive. It\u2019s a good idea to keep a notebook and pen handy and bring it with you to every meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after the first few weeks\u2014it\u2019s always best practice to actively listen and take notes! So start early and set up good habits for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Put your phone away<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems like we\u2019re on our phones 24\/7, but resist the urge to check your phone at work. You don\u2019t want to look like you\u2019re distracted or not working\u2014especially if your boss walks by. If you receive an important call, excuse yourself and take your phone out of the office. Otherwise, save your scrolling for lunchtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be friendly but professional<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Interacting with coworkers is different than interacting with friends, family, or classmates. This doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be friendly and get to know your coworkers. Start by keeping your conversations to work-related topics, and eventually you\u2019ll build comradery with your colleagues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your best bet to is wait and see how your colleagues interact. Some may have more casual conversations and be open to sharing about their families and personal lives. But others may prefer to keep their personal lives private. If someone asks you about your hometown, school, or family, then you should feel free to share what you like and ask them similar questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more <a
