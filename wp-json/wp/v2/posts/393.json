Find It on Handshake!"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Summer offers college students the kind of flexibility you won\u2019t see during any other season. Condensed courses split into half-semesters means classes can go twice as fast as those offered during fall and spring. Plus, there are fewer students enrolled. Naturally, summer becomes a catchup semester for many students who want to get ahead by a few credits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer can also be your season to gain valuable work experience. If you\u2019re considering working during the summer season, you\u2019re probably bouncing a few questions around in your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-time or part-time? <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Intern (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\">Intern<\/a> or volunteer? On-campus or off-campus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any summer employment option you choose will benefit your career path in the long run, but to make the most of it, you need to find a balance between your summer course schedule and workload.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students using Handshake have a variety of tools at their disposal to find a job that works well for them. In many cases, Handshake partners with your college\u2019s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\">career services center<\/a> to deliver jobs most relevant to college students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know when to search<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If possible, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"start your job search no later than February (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fastweb.com\/student-news\/articles\/spring-semester-timeline-for-landing-a-summer-job\" target=\"_blank\">start your job search no later than February<\/a>. This will give you plenty of time to create and gather the necessary materials (such as resumes, cover letters, etc.) prior to applying. If you\u2019re applying to an internship, there are a few additional <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"dates and milestones you should memorize and meet (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/save-these-dates-internship-start-dates-and-milestones\/\" target=\"_blank\">dates and milestones you should memorize and meet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know how to search<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve logged into Handshake and navigated to the job search page, just enter \u201csummer\u201d in the search field to view all available seasonal jobs. Employers that are looking for summer talent will make the word \u201csummer\u201d part of the job title. If you want to get more granular, you can also search by \u201csummer job\u201d or \u201csummer internship.\u201d You\u2019ll also notice a field to the right where you can include a desired location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you know exactly what you want, go down the list of available filters to fine tune your search.

This could give you an edge if you meet their highest standards.<\/li><li>Work authorization: If you\u2019re an international student and require sponsorship or other support, this is where you can indicate as much.<\/li><li>Industry: Search for summer opportunities within the industries you want, whether it\u2019s in finance, tech, healthcare, leisure, or any other industry.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Job function: You can filter down to the specific job type you\u2019re looking for. Think about this like you would your job title: if you want a teaching job in the summer, then that is what you should indicate in this field.<\/li><li>Major: Plug in your major here if you wish to see the kind of summer jobs available based on your area of study.<\/li><li>Employer: If you have an employer you want to work for, make sure to enter the company name in this field.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s all you need to know to find the right summer job using Handshake!
