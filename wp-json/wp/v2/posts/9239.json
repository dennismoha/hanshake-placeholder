If you haven\u2019t worked in an office or professional environment before, you\u2019re probably unsure. While it varies from office to office, there are some general guidelines for how to communicate at work. Here are five practices to adopt, and five to avoid at your job or internship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do follow good email etiquette<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep it concise.<\/strong> People are busy and receive a multitude of emails every day. If they open your message and it\u2019s a mini novel, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll close it if they&#8217;re busy. Or, they\u2019ll quickly glance through it, go toward the end to find your main point, and move on. It\u2019s best to keep your emails as concise as possible. Include the background information they need to know, and what questions or requests you have for them.<\/li><li><strong>Be specific in subject lines.<\/strong> A great subject line summarizes the main point of your email. This helps your recipient understand the purpose of the email\u2014and they can quickly search for it later when it\u2019s buried in their inbox. Something general like \u201cQuestion for you\u201d or \u201cProject request\u201d is not helpful. \u201cMarketing plan for June 15 campaign meeting\u201d is an example of a subject line that includes useful details.<\/li><li><strong>Be careful with \u201cReply All.\u201d<\/strong> Before you hit \u201cReply All\u201d in a large group email, think about who really needs to be included. If your response is only meant for one person, or a smaller group, select \u201cReply\u201d instead and include people individually. And be careful with company-wide messages\u2014you don&#8217;t want to \u201cReply All\u201d to those!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do ask questions and actively listen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re in a meeting or talking to coworkers, put away distractions so you can concentrate and listen. When someone is speaking, don\u2019t think about the points you want to make, or what you\u2019re going to say in response. Be present and listen to them, so you don\u2019t miss anything or reiterate something they\u2019ve just covered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you\u2019re unsure of something or need more information, always feel comfortable asking questions. Work is your opportunity to grow and learn, so don\u2019t worry about asking a lot of questions. Your coworkers will appreciate your curiosity and desire to learn\u2014and you may bring up a question that someone else in the room was scared to ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do be respectful<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should always speak to your coworkers in a respectful, polite manner. Even if you disagree or are having a difficult discussion, always live by the golden rule\u2014treat them the way you\u2019d want to be treated. Don\u2019t raise your voice, don\u2019t be rude, and definitely don\u2019t curse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for your body language: don\u2019t cross your arms or roll your eyes. These send a message that you are closed off, not listening, or being dismissive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do ask for\u2014and accept\u2014feedback<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most organizations have a formal review process every six months or year. But you don\u2019t need to wait for the review cycle to ask for feedback from your manager. If you don\u2019t have regular one-on-one meetings on your calendar, ask your manager if they are open to this. This way, you can have real-time feedback on your projects and performance\u2014and there won\u2019t be any surprises during review time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that no one is perfect and everyone, including your manager, receives feedback and constructive criticism from time to time. Do your best to not take it personally, and don\u2019t become defensive during these conversations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the feedback seriously and do your best to incorporate it moving forward. Feedback reviews are there to promote your professional development and learning, so welcome it as an opportunity to grow in your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do discuss sensitive topics privately<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to discuss a confidential or difficult topic, you should meet with your manager or coworker privately. Ask them if they have a few minutes to talk with you, or if they prefer a set meeting, send them a calendar invite.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be helpful to organize your thoughts and talking points before the meeting. For example, if you are having difficulty with a project or colleague, write down a few notes that will keep you on topic and provide necessary background to your manager. Additionally, brainstorm a few potential solutions that you can discuss. That way, you aren\u2019t just bringing them a problem and relying on them to solve it for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t be too casual<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid using emojis, multiple exclamation points, and non business-related abbreviations (SMH&#8230;), especially in email. Depending on the employers, it may be ok for in-office messaging like Slack. But be aware of how your coworkers communicate, and wait until you\u2019ve been in the organization a while before going the more casual route. When in doubt, it\u2019s best to be polite but professional across all platforms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t interrupt&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In meetings, or in one-on-one conversations, always wait for your colleague to finish speaking before you begin. This goes back to the \u2018be respectful\u2019 rule\u2014be courteous to your coworkers and let them finish their thoughts. Interrupting someone is rude, and tells your coworkers that you believe what you have to say is more important than what they have to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, if you need to talk to a coworker, but you can see they are busy\u2014don\u2019t interrupt them. Wait until they aren\u2019t typing, on the phone, or speaking to someone else. You can always send them a message and ask them to chat with you when they have a few minutes. If they have a \u2018do not disturb\u2019 setting on their messaging, or a focus time hold on their calendar, you should wait before sending them a message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t discuss controversial topics&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of work like the Thanksgiving table: try to avoid politics, religion, and other controversial topics, because it\u2019s bound to get uncomfortable for someone. Even if others are engaged in a conversation like this, don\u2019t throw your hat in the ring, whether you agree with them or not. You never know if you\u2019re making other people uncomfortable. So, it\u2019s best to change the subject or walk away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t bring personal business work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you best to put your personal phone out of view, and don\u2019t make personal calls at your desk. If your phone rings and it\u2019s important, excuse yourself and take the call from outside the office. If you need to schedule an appointment or call a family member back, save it for lunchtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, don\u2019t carry on long conversations about your personal life at the office. A little bit of non-work related talk is fine, but if you\u2019re chatting about your dog\u2019s birthday party at your desk for 30 minutes, it\u2019ll look like you\u2019re slacking off\u2014and be distracting to those around you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t participate in gossip&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is still something that you may encounter in a professional setting. It\u2019s never a good idea to talk about your coworkers negatively or share gossip behind their backs. Gossiping makes you look untrustworthy and unprofessional, so don\u2019t be tempted. If someone else starts gossiping to you, don\u2019t engage with it and find a way to change the subject.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how best to communicate with
