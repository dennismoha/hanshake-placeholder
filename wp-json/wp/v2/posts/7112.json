And sending a well-written thank you email and\/or letter soon after your interview is essential. Here are some tips for writing a thank you note that will impress employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you should send a thank you<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It is a best-practice courtesy. <\/strong>A thank you note shows the employer that you appreciate their time, and for considering you for the job.<\/li><li><strong>It\u2019s a chance to remind the employer why you\u2019re the right candidate. <\/strong>Did you forget to mention something in the interview that you really want the employer to know? Are there any qualifications that you want to remind them of? This is your opportunity.<\/li><li><strong>It helps the employer remember you.<\/strong> Seeing your thank you note in their inbox is a great way to have the employer remember you positively as they\u2019re making the decision of who to hire.<\/li><li><strong>Is there anything you want to follow up on?<\/strong> If there was a question that you didn&#8217;t quite know how to answer\u2014or didn\u2019t go the way you\u2019d like\u2014you can use this opportunity for a second chance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips for writing your note<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be prompt<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan to send your thank you <strong>within 24 hours<\/strong> of your interview. Have a general outline for your note ahead of time to help you. Then, right after your interview ends, write down anything you want to reference in your note. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about something you enjoyed discussing, any skills or experiences you want to mention again, and anything else you want to include. This will help you quickly craft your follow up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Personalize  <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did the interviewer share something specific they like about their job or the organization? Do you two share a common interest, hobby, or alma mater? Be sure to include any personal touches to your note that will make it\u2014and you\u2014stand out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be concise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers are busy and receive a lot of email, so they may just skim over a long email or letter. Keep your writing brief and to the point\u2014one to two paragraphs is all you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Close with next steps <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>End your note with a forward-looking statement. Either that you look forward to hearing from them, discussing next steps, or that you will be following up.&nbsp;You can also mention that they should feel free to contact you with additional questions, or if there is anything they would like to discuss with you in more detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Proofread <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s always a good idea to double and triple-check anything you send to an employer, whether it\u2019s your cover letter, resume, or thank you. Ask a friend or family member to read over it and help you catch <strong>spelling <\/strong>or<strong> grammar<\/strong> mistakes. And be sure to check that the <strong>interviewer\u2019s name<\/strong> is spelled correctly!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Email or snail mail? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, an email thank you will be fine, especially if you had a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/things-to-remember-during-virtual-interview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual interview<\/a>. However, if you met the employer in person, or they strike you as being more traditional, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to send a typed letter in the mail as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the subject line of your email, a simple \u201cThank you\u201d and your name will suffice. Have a professional closing (\u201cSincerely\u201d or \u201cBest regards\u201d will work) and signature with your full name and contact information.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is an example of a typed thank you letter:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Date<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Your contact information<\/strong><\/em><br><em>[First name Last name<\/em><br><em>City, State Zip<\/em><br><em>Email Address<\/em><br><em>Phone number]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>The interviewer\u2019s contact information<\/strong><\/em><br><em>[Mr.\/Mrs.\/Ms. First name Last name<\/em><br><em>Title<\/em><br><em>Employer name<\/em><br><em>Address<\/em><br><em>City, State Zip]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Professional greeting<\/em>:<\/strong> <em>[Dear Mr.\/Mrs.\/Ms. Last name,]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday about the [job title] role at [company name].
