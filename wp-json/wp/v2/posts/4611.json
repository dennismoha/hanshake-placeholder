The results show that you care a lot about this issue\u2014and companies that want to hire you should take note.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mental health is a top priority<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 65% of students surveyed told us that they\u2019re prioritizing mental health as a result of the pandemic and would like to see support from employers. But while students certainly hope their future jobs will provide mental health benefits, it\u2019s clear that you simply can\u2019t wait\u2026 almost half of students report increased anxiety <strong>right now<\/strong> due to the uncertainty of the current economic climate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you&#8217;re being proactive. Among our most visited blogs of 2020 is <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/free-services-for-college-students-covid-19\/\">this list<\/a> of free resources for college students, which offers tools to care for mental and emotional health during COVID-19.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody has their own mental health journey, but sometimes approachable tips can help you get started. One way to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-manage-stress-at-your-internship\/\">manage stress<\/a> is by practicing mindfulness meditation for a few minutes each day, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccih.nih.gov\/health\/meditation-in-depth\">has a positive impact<\/a> on both anxiety and depression. Working to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/sleep\/how-to-sleep-better\">improve sleep habits<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/stretching-relieve-stress-anxiety_l_5ea19b05c5b699978a347cca\">practicing healthy movement<\/a> each day, and turning to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uofmhealth.org\/health-library\/uz2255\">relaxing breathing exercises<\/a> can also positively affect your mental health during trying times.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>College job-seekers want mental health benefits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you also hope that employers will be equally proactive in providing benefits for mental health. 62.5% of students feel it\u2019s important for their future employer to provide mental health benefits, especially after COVID-19. If a &#8220;Zoom office&#8221; is in your future, this is even more vital. Over half of you say companies should invest <em>more<\/em> in employees\u2019 mental health while working remotely.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just coverage for therapy and meditation sessions that matter, though. Nearly half of students told us that companies\u2019 HR policies should actively support non-discrimination around mental health issues. Plus, it&#8217;s important that employers hiring college students provide extra guidance for coping with a newly virtual workplace! In our survey, 51% of students expressed concerns about the increasingly common shift to remote work impacting their mental health. Your two biggest fears include feelings of isolation (52.8%) and a lack of work-life balance (49.8%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve already shown unbelievable fortitude, adaptability, and creativity when faced with all of 2020\u2019s curveballs. Even this unprecedented year is no match for you! There\u2019s never been a one-size-fits-all solution for mental health, but healthy habits and authentic support in the workplace can make a world of difference\u2014and hopefully employers are paying attention. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Survey results show college students&#8217; mental health priorities \u2014 and employers should pay
