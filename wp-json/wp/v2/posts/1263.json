Your schedule is already jam-packed with classes, going to work, and commuting to and from all of these activities. Then, on top of all that, it\u2019s still highly valued that you make even more time to work somewhere else \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/considering-a-paid-internship-read-this-first\/\">often for <em>free<\/em><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your internship needs to be close enough to home that you can sneak in some study time between commitments, and also the type of gig that future employers might see as the tipping point between hiring you and someone else.

In a panic, I turned to Handshake. Handshake was able to find internship openings based on what I was looking for. I was looking for a summer internship that was preferably paid that was located somewhere in the city or in North Jersey.
