The process of transitioning so many aspects of life from in-person to behind screens hasn\u2019t been easy: according to our latest Handshake student survey, while students recognize the necessity of the virtual job hunt, more than half of students have concerns about their ability to make connections and communicate effectively online.. But amid these challenges, ingenuity and growth have flourished. Not only have college students learned to prioritize what\u2019s truly important to them, like <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/college-students-mental-health-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">their mental health<\/a>, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also how to conduct career exploration safely and effectively using digital recruiting tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-career-fairs-are-here-next-stop-getting-hired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual career fairs<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re one of the many students or recent grads who has participated in the job search during this time, you\u2019ve likely felt some of the same pain points as your peers. Read on for the results of our latest student survey \u2014 along with pointers for making the virtual interview and career fair process easier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The virtual job search has its benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pivot to fully virtual recruitment might have been an unexpected curveball for students, but there are bright sides. When asked what they like about the virtual job search process, almost half of students reported feeling less intimidated when meeting with potential employers. More than half of respondents who feel this profound sense of relief are women; connecting face-to-face in a calm, virtual setting appears preferable for this cohort over trying to self-advocate and make a memorable impact over the dull roar of traditional gymnasium career fairs. Some of the other top reasons why students like virtual recruiting events are that these types of events reduce <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-attend-virtual-recruiting-events\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scheduling<\/a> barriers, and participants feel they\u2019re able to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-11-sessions-the-8-tips-you-need-to-know-before-meeting-an-employer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">better prepare for interviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Communication and connection are common challenges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, when asked what they <em>don\u2019t<\/em> like about the virtual job search process, 52% of students reported finding it challenging to communicate effectively in online settings and that they worry about not making a genuine connection with recruiters during virtual events.

When asked their opinion about employers that have not adopted virtual fairs, virtual events, and virtual recruitment tools, many students believe this failure to adapt will have a negative impact on their recruiting efforts. Here were their top answers:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>41.2% said that these employers will eventually<em> have<\/em> to adopt virtual recruitment tools&nbsp;<\/li><li>19.4% believe slow-to-evolve employers are going to fall behind&nbsp;<\/li><li>11.8% simply say that it will be harder for the employers to connect with them and their peers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, that\u2019s more than 70% of students who believe that employers will either be forced to adapt, or will struggle to keep up as their competitors adopt superior recruiting practices in a virtual world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Companies could make the process easier&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to adopting virtual recruiting tools to adapt to the evolving COVID-19 landscape, students feel that employers could do more to make their virtual recruiting process better. According to our survey data, the top three ways employers can make students\u2019 virtual job search\/interview easier is by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Being specific about what they\u2019re looking for in candidates&nbsp;<\/li><li>Detailing out the process ahead of time<\/li><li>Offering guides on how to navigate virtual events and fairs&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Virtual interview prep is essential&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After they\u2019ve selected confidence-boosting <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/plan-your-virtual-career-fair-outfit-in-30-seconds-or-less\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual career fair outfits<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/fuel-your-job-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fueled their job searches<\/a> with favorite snacks and drinks, students find a few key preparation rituals key to their success at virtual recruiting events. More than two-thirds of students (69.1%) research the companies they\u2019re meeting before a virtual job interview. Nearly half of students (46.7%) participate in mock interviews to work through their nerves and practice answers to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-4-most-common-internship-interview-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">common questions<\/a>. Finally, more than 40% of students utilize meditation and deep breathing to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-manage-stress-at-your-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manage stress<\/a> and calm their jittery nerves before hopping on their interview call.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by\u00a0<a
