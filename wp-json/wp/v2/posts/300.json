It\u2019s a micro-process that runs parallel to a grander, lifelong process of personal development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>College presents the first opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-career-is-right-for-me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"make decisions about your future career (opens in a new tab)\">make decisions about your future career<\/a>. For some, it\u2019s declaring the major they\u2019ve always wanted to pursue. For others, it\u2019s continuing the earlier stages of personal development until ready they\u2019re ready for the next step. However, for most students, that first year encompasses an initial, crucial stage in the career development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exploring options and opportunities (1st year of college)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you should explore even if you\u2019re 110% sure of the major and career you\u2019re considering.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not saying that you <em>have<\/em><strong> <\/strong>to explore career options, but it never hurts to prepare. Don\u2019t rush into a major or career based on societal pressures or expectations; not everyone is as dead-set in their initial plans as they seem! In fact, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"80% of US college students (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.purdueexponent.org\/campus\/article_9bcfd88e-9e4b-5102-80a0-485bfe770299.html\" target=\"_blank\">80% of US college students<\/a> will change their major at least once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time to explore what your campus has to offer. Check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career services (opens in a new tab)\">career services<\/a> offices on campus to find out more useful information about your major and career options. Network, find advice online, and ask others who pursued the same career path how they achieved the goals you\u2019re chasing. If you need help getting there, Handshake gives you access to a community of recent grads so you can ask these questions! You can also start your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"internship (opens in a new tab)\">internship<\/a> search early through Handshake \u2014 just to see what the prospects are like.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, students remain in an exploratory stage for a few semesters \u2014 up to a year. It\u2019s really the best time to reflect on your interests, skills, and values and how they can affect you in the next stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deciding and preparing for the future (2nd &#8211; 3rd year of college)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when your career goals begin to come into play. Once you\u2019ve decided on a major and\/or career, try laying out the trajectory to see where it will take you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategizing goes beyond just what classes you need to take. When interviewing for an internship, your interviewers don\u2019t want to hear about your grades or the classes you took; they want to know what you did with that experience! Detail how you transitioned from classroom to shadow or volunteer. When you\u2019re ready for that entry level position, interview questions are further disconnected from your college experiences and rely more on \u201creal world\u201d experience&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making firm decisions in your career goals and path ensure your preparation for your career by engaging in the relevant professional experiences mentioned above. They\u2019ll also help you start building your resume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transitioning into the next steps of life (4th year of college)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition period starts with your first serious job search, and finding the right entry-level or no-experience job relevant to your major, skills, and experiences. With a strong resume and several <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/mastering-the-internship-cover-letter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cover (opens in a new tab)\">cover<\/a> letters in hand, this is when you start the application process. Doing so before graduating will make the transition easier. This is especially true when employers on Handshake are actively looking for students by attributes like \u201cexpected graduation date.\u201d Many times, these employers hope to fill these spots by the end of graduation season. This makes pre-graduation a high-demand time for employers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Condensing popular career development theories into our own 3-stage process for
