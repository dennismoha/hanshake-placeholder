Does it seem like everyone else has it&nbsp; \u201ctogether\u201d and you don\u2019t know where to start?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just you.

Colleges are becoming increasingly aware of the gap between education and employment, employing and advertising their <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career services (opens in a new tab)\">career services<\/a> centers.

Career counselors are on the come-up. The <em>Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/em> predicts that the field is growing faster than average, and it\u2019s probably due to the fact that students are seeking more <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/7-career-advice-questions-to-ask-your-career-advisor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career guidance (opens in a new tab)\">career guidance<\/a> than ever before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What does a career counselor do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/finding-your-career-advisor-could-mean-finding-your-career\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career advisor (opens in a new tab)\">career advisor<\/a> or coach\u2014yes, they\u2019re different\u2014who might help with more concrete tasks like practicing networking and interviewing skills, career counselors help you understand your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/career-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"professional path (opens in a new tab)\">professional path<\/a> and figure out the right career fit.
