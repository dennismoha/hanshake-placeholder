This guide breaks down the sections of a resume and what information to include in each. You\u2019ll also find resume do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to help you avoid common mistakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Resume Outline<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contact information<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Start your resume by listing your contact info at the top of the page. Include your first and last <strong>name<\/strong>, <strong>location<\/strong> (city and state), <strong>phone number <\/strong>and <strong>email address<\/strong>. Include any <strong>additional links<\/strong>, like an online portfolio, that are relevant to the roles you\u2019re applying for in this section.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a more &#8220;professional&#8221; email address yet, now is the time to create one. Keep it simple and consider just using your name (janedoe@emailprovider.com).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Summary&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While optional, it&#8217;s helpful to include a summary statement when applying for an internship or entry-level job. Think of it as a short \u201chighlight reel\u201d that will capture the employer\u2019s attention and explain why you&#8217;re the right candidate for the role. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your summary should briefly outline your relevant skills, experience, and professional goals. Your summary should be specific and customized depending on the role you\u2019re applying for. It should also be short\u2014two or three sentences is sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Education<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students and new grads should put your education at the top of your resume. Once you have more work experience under your belt, you should move this section under experience. If you\u2019re in your first or second year of school, you can also list your high school information. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include your school name, major, degree, and your graduation month and year (or expected date). You can also list courses you\u2019ve taken or major projects completed that are relevant to the job. Also highlight any <strong>academic honors <\/strong>or<strong> awards<\/strong> you\u2019ve received\u2014don\u2019t be shy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about <strong>GPA<\/strong>? Including your GPA can help boost your resume, especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience. If your major GPA is higher than your overall GPA, you can include that instead, but be sure to list it as such. Once you\u2019re two to three years out of school and have more work experience, remove it from your resume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common way to organize your experience section, especially when you&#8217;re starting out, is to list in reverse chronological order\u2014meaning the most recent experience is listed first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where you\u2019ll outline current or previous<strong> internships<\/strong> and <strong>part-time <\/strong>or <strong>on-campus jobs<\/strong>. If you don\u2019t have much previous work or internship experience, emphasize your involvement with <strong>clubs <\/strong>and<strong> organizations<\/strong>, <strong>volunteering<\/strong> opportunities, and other ways you\u2019ve taken on leadership positions. All of these experiences, on and off campus, have helped you gain transferable skills, and make you a desirable candidate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under each employer or organization name, include the title you held and list a few bullets describing your responsibilities and achievements. Start each bullet with an <strong>action verb, <\/strong>not a pronoun or your name. Words like &#8220;led&#8221;, &#8220;analyzed&#8221;, &#8220;coordinated&#8221;, and &#8220;designed&#8221;. Keep the thesaurus handy for this section! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include <strong>numbers, percentages<\/strong> or other concrete measures of success whenever possible.\u00a0And make sure you read through the job description and find relevant <strong>keywords <\/strong>you can include in your resume. This will help your resume get noticed when recruiters (or recruiting software) are quickly scanning it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of skills to include on your resume: <strong>hard or technical skills, <\/strong>and<strong> soft skills<\/strong>. Examples of hard skills include a foreign language or an industry-specific software program. Soft skills include communication, problem solving, and creativity. One type isn\u2019t more important than the other\u2014employers are looking for both soft skills and hard skills in potential job candidates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your skills should demonstrate that you\u2019re a good fit for the industry and role you\u2019re applying for. If you have skills that are mentioned in the job description, definitely list them here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Have a draft? Ask for feedback<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a draft of your resume done, and you\u2019ve read through it a few times, share it with a family member or other contact with professional experience. Ask them for feedback on how you\u2019ve phrased your objective and experience. Have you made a compelling case for why you\u2019re a great candidate? Does your resume fit with the industry and role you\u2019re applying for?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then contact your school\u2019s Career Center and make an appointment to go over your resume together. The Career Center staff are experts on what makes a great resume, so reach out to them for advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Resume Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be concise.<\/strong> Keep your resume to one page.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Be consistent.<\/strong> Use the same font, layout and style throughout (that includes spacing, indentation, capitalization, verb tense and bulleted lists).<\/li><li><strong>Spell it out.<\/strong> Don\u2019t use abbreviations or slang.<\/li><li><strong>No crazy fonts.<\/strong> Choose one that is easy to read, such as Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri, and stick to size 11 or 12.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Proofread<\/strong>. Double and triple check your spelling and grammar!\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When your resume is ready, the last step is to save it as a PDF and upload it to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your Handshake profile<\/a>!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on how to upload a doc to your
