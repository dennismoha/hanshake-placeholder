Luckily, there are plenty of students and fresh grads who\u2019ve secured roles on Handshake and are happy to share their guidance for others in their shoes! Check out tips and tricks to securing your first internship or job on Handshake, straight from current Handshake users. Freshmen and other first-time users, this one\u2019s for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cHaving your Handshake profile set up is really important. Employers are going to want to see who you are and learn a little more about you when you\u2019re submitting your applications to them. Personalize [your profile] and give them a short summary of who you are, what you\u2019re looking for, and what your experiences are. I think that\u2019s important to give them a more personal feel than just a piece of paper that explains about you.\u201d<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><\/p><cite>Crystal, Oakland University<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cSometimes applying can be a bit of a numbers game. You may feel like you\u2019ve gotten so many rejections, but keep on applying even if you\u2019ve applied to hundreds of jobs. All it takes is one person to say yes and believe in you.\u201d<\/p><cite>Erika, UC Berkeley<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out either using Handshake or even cold emailing, saying that you\u2019re interested in a position and here are my qualifications. Handshake also has the contact information of the employer, so there\u2019s always ways to reach out to them. And potentially if you\u2019re past the first hurdle and have gotten an interview, you can reach out to people who work in the same position or at the company.\u201d<\/p><cite>Deval, UC Irvine<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cNetworking is extremely important. I would say don\u2019t come in [to a networking event] thinking that you&#8217;re going to get a job from talking to one person; rather it\u2019s for you to learn from your experiences and also learn from their experiences. Going in with the intention that you can learn something from [an alumni or recruiter] is essential when growing as a professional employee.\u201d <\/p><cite>Nicholas, California Baptist University<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBe open and honest in interviews and when you\u2019re applying to jobs. Even if you don\u2019t have all the experience, employers want to know that you\u2019re eager to learn.\u201d<\/p><cite>Elena, Oakland University<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cSomething that helped me stand out when I was getting recruited for an internship is contacting the recruiter directly and emailing to introduce myself. I included the candidate number job ID number. It really helped me establish connections even if I didn\u2019t get that internship. I still have connections with those recruiters now.\u201d<\/p><cite>Carly, NYU<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tips for finding your first internship on Handshake, straight from students who have recently been in your shoes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034980,"featured_media":9177,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_anchor_podcast":"","jetpack_anchor_episode":"","jetpack_anchor_spotify_show":""},"categories":[1363],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Do I Find My First Internship?
