Having a flexible job can include making your own hours, taking on projects that interest you, and meeting professionals from different industries. Flexible jobs are great for those who want to keep some freedom in their personal life and pursue specific life goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the most flexible jobs?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Part-Time Jobs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common flexible jobs usually fall under the category of <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/part-time-jobs-for-college-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">part-time<\/a> work. Part-time jobs give college students times to focus on school, while also saving for the future. Roles like cashiers and baristas are popular among students looking to build soft skills and keep a flexible schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Freelance Jobs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers are also masters at keeping their jobs flexible. Usually companies hire freelancers for singular projects, which allows them to do as little or as much work as they can handle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Contractor Jobs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to a freelancer, contractors are hired out by a company to work on projects for them. Both are able to make their hours as long as the work gets done by a certain point. The only difference is that freelancers can take on as many clients as they desire, while contractors usually work for one company at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In what jobs can I make my own hours?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting your own work schedule can greatly up both your productivity and overall happiness. If this seems appealing to you, consider the following roles that allow you to make your own hours:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Consultants<\/li><li>Freelance Writers\/Editors<\/li><li>Sales Representatives<\/li><li>Real Estate Agents<\/li><li>Hair Stylists<\/li><li>Medical Transcriptionists<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>How much do flexible jobs pay?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all jobs, the salary that you will receive depends on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/bls\/blswage.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">where you live and what kind of job you have<\/a>. If you\u2019re a contractor or freelancer, your years of experience and previous roles could determine your pay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to find a flexible job near me?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When searching for flexible jobs near you, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/find-entry-level-jobs-near-you-with-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entry-level<\/a> or otherwise, it\u2019s always best to use the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-the-jobs-you-want-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake job filter and keyword search<\/a>. Start by searching the available jobs and entering the job title, city you want to work in, or terms like \u201ccontractor\u201d or \u201cfreelance\u201d if those apply to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to find a flexible job online?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the following points about finding a flexible online job:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Assess what you\u2019re good at and consider doing consulting or freelance work that allows you to work from home and plan your own schedule.<\/li><li>Search <a href=\"http:\/\/joinhandshake.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake<\/a> and your school\u2019s local job boards for virtual positions opening up soon and apply!<\/li><li>Get in touch with your network (professional and personal) and inquire about any virtual job openings at their companies.<\/li><li>If you currently have a job that you would like to be remote, have an honest conversation with your manager about transitioning to a more virtual friendly position.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more information on this?

When looking for a flexible job, consider your degree and the skills that you learned during undergrad and in other internships\/jobs. Research jobs that are common for your degree and apply accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I put on my resume?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many places hiring contractors and part-time employees are looking for similar keywords in <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-new-grad-resume-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resumes<\/a>, but what makes the right candidate is listing the skills that make you stand out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>List your past experiences\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve never had a job in this field before, you definitely have skills from past experiences you can offer.

It\u2019s always a good idea to mention that you have strong industry specific skills, know how to manage projects, or have had experience leading and also being a teamplayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should I write in my cover letter?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides your stellar resume, your cover letter is another chance to really sell yourself as a future virtual employee or freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four things you should include in your cover letter:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Previous experiences and how they apply to the role you are applying for<\/li><li>Why you\u2019re interested in working with them<\/li><li>Specific projects they\u2019ve worked on that you admire<\/li><li>If contracting or freelancing, why you <em>personally<\/em> are capable of help them<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-entry-level-job-cover-letter-that-will-get-you-noticed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article with proper formatting techniques<\/a> and more in depth information about the perfect cover letter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking for more flexibility at work?
