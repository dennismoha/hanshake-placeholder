You can sign up early to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-career-fairs-are-here-next-stop-getting-hired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attend sessions with the employers<\/a> you\u2019re interested in, to learn about jobs and internships for students like you at your school. Group and one-on-one sessions will help you get an inside look at employers and find <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-great-companies-to-work-for-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companies you\u2019d like to work for<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what are employers looking for during these sessions, and how can you stand out from the crowd? Here are three tips from employers that will help you impress them and get on their list of potential job candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be prepared and curious<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve filled up your schedule of virtual sessions, it\u2019s important to research the employers you\u2019ll be meeting with. Start by reading through their page on Handshake to get an overview of the organization and read student reviews. Then you can expand your research by looking at their company website, and doing a quick online search for recent news articles, press releases and other information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a short list of questions ready to ask employers during your sessions. What do you want to learn more about? What questions will help you decide if the company is a good fit for you? You can ask about company culture, professional development opportunities, mentorship programs, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Make sure to check out the open jobs and internships on the employer&#8217;s Handshake page. They are looking for students to hire at virtual career fairs, so  chances are they\u2019ll want to discuss current opportunities with you during the session.&nbsp;<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arrive on time and stick around<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to make a great first impression with employers is to be on time for your sessions. You can enter a video session five minutes before the session begins. It\u2019s a good idea to set phone alerts or calendar reminders for your sessions, to ensure you\u2019re logged into Handshake and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also really important that you <strong>stay for the entire session<\/strong>. If you have a one-on-one session with an employer, you wouldn\u2019t dream of logging out early, right? Well, the same goes for any group session you\u2019re attending. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the session isn\u2019t quite what you thought you were signing up for, or all of your questions were answered early. Doesn\u2019t matter\u2014just like you, employers have busy schedules and their time is valuable. Being on time and staying until the end of a session demonstrates that you\u2019re responsible and respectful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get ready to hit send on your follow-up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prepare a draft of your follow-up message to an employer <strong>before you attend<\/strong> their session. That way, you\u2019ll be a step ahead once the session is over. Start by thanking the employer ambassador for their time and for sharing information about the organization. Then, include something specific you enjoyed discussing or learning about, and reiterate your interest in the company. Finally, indicate that you&#8217;re taking next steps such as applying for an open job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have drafts ready before the fair, you can quickly edit and send them after your sessions\u2014and be one of the first students to follow up. This will definitely help you stand out to employers!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more useful tips?
