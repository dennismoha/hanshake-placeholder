But it\u2019s important to remember that, as a college student or recent grad, you\u2019re not the only one adjusting to the shift to online recruiting!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When speaking to Handshake about global commercial real estate firm <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/cushman-wakefield-15334\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cushman &amp; Wakefield<\/a>\u2019s innovative <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/cushman-wakefield-recommended-reading-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual Exposure Program<\/a>, Campus Recruiter Katie Flaschar shared a few simple ways that students can make a good impression during the virtual job hunt. It turns out, it\u2019s as easy as being active online and practicing good internet etiquette! Practicing positive habits like these when building a relationship with your recruiter can even be key to them considering you for <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/banking-internship-full-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a full-time role after your internship<\/a>, or later on down the road when they want to connect an incoming hire <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-a-mentor\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with a great mentor<\/a> at the company.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, read Katie\u2019s advice for standing out to recruiters like her online.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Be active on job platforms; follow, engage, &amp; respond promptly to messages<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to catching a recruiter\u2019s eye, Katie says that one of the key things students can do is stay active on online job platforms, such as Handshake. A lot of students are told about the importance of online career profiles by their university\u2019s career services center, says Katie, \u201cbut they don\u2019t take it very seriously.\u201d By connecting with recruiters online and engaging with them virtually, Katie says, you show your hunger for opportunities through your online presence. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice? Just engage! She suggests \u201cliking things by the companies you&#8217;re interested in and by the recruiters that you&#8217;ve met \u2014 engaging in that way, sending messages, following up.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads to the next tip&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Proactively follow up about interested and qualified positions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve applied to or interviewed for a position that you\u2019re excited about and worry that the online shift might have impacted the process, don\u2019t hesitate to explicitly reaffirm your interest. \u201cThis is the time to follow up on positions,\u201d Katie believes. When reaching out to a recruiter, she advises using a \u201cno pressure\u201d approach in case the company\u2019s hiring situation has changed. Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><em>Hi there, I got interviewed a while ago for [X position]. I know that COVID-19 is still happening and might have impacted staffing plans, so no pressure, but I was just curious if there has been any movement in the process. I am still extremely interested in the opportunity if it\u2019s available!<\/em><\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of message, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield recruiter says, really drives home an applicant\u2019s interest level to hiring managers who sometimes need a nudge: \u201cSome have got a lot going on, and so having that reminder from a great candidate is always helpful.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Consider your social media presence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour social media presence is so important virtually \u2014 and in general!\u201d says Katie. And she\u2019s not the only one who thinks so; Handshake VP of Higher Education &amp; Student Success Christine Cruzvergara <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/03\/29\/new-grads-may-face-worst-job-market-since-2008-financial-crisis.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">often talks about the importance of considering your digital impact<\/a> in three distinct areas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>digital brand<\/strong>: how you represent yourself online to present the professional you want to be (now and in the future)<\/li><li><strong>digital shadow<\/strong>: what a company or recruiter will find when they Google potential hires, which should align with your professional brand<\/li><li><strong>digital engagement<\/strong>: how you engage across various social platforms<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your behavior during the online job hunt, from your public social media profiles to your polite follow-up messages, can be the secret to catching the right recruiter\u2019s eye \u2014 and hopefully landing the job or internship offer you\u2019ve dreamt of.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For even more awesome lessons for diving into the professional world, check out <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\"
