Whether you&#8217;ve been searching and haven&#8217;t found a good fit yet, or are just starting to explore opportunities\u2014we know finding an internship in a short period of time isn&#8217;t easy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that once you\u2019ve <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-on-your-handshake-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\">completed your Handshake profile<\/a>, you already have an advantage. Here are some ways that you can fast-forward to accepting an offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Follow employers you want to work for<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>When you follow an employer on Handshake, you get important updates that can boost your internship search. Just click the \u201cFollow\u201d button on the upper right-hand corner of an employer\u2019s Handshake page, and you\u2019ll be the first to know when they post new jobs and internships. This will help you get a head start on applying to relevant opportunities and ensure you don\u2019t miss application deadlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll also be notified when the employers you follow are hosting an on-campus event or virtual event on Handshake, or will be at a career fair. So you can plan to attend these events and meet recruiters face-to-face or online\u2014an invaluable way to stand out to employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Explore more employers and cities<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>There are employers of all sizes and in every industry on Handshake\u2014so look for opportunities beyond the most notable names. Smaller companies and local businesses may still have open positions. The good news is that there are nearly <strong>500,000 employers<\/strong> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>on Handshake<\/strong><\/a>, so the chances are good that you\u2019ll find a match.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several Handshake resources to help you learn more about any employer, including those you\u2019re unfamiliar with. When you click on an employer\u2019s Handshake page, you can see reviews from other students and alumni who have worked there. Reviews are helpful for learning about the internship responsibilities, company culture, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if you\u2019re able and open to living somewhere else during your internship, you can broaden your search by location. Go to the \u201cYour Interests\u201d section of your profile and add more places you\u2019d like to work in. This will open up a bigger pool of employers and internships available to you, and will increase the chances of recruiters finding you during their searches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"remote location\/\u201dwork from home\u201d options (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-make-the-most-of-a-remote-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\">remote location\/\u201dwork from home\u201d options<\/a>?

This will show you relevant job postings that have the option of remote work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Enlist the help of other students and alumni<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more than <strong>six million<\/strong> <strong>students and recent alumni<\/strong> actively using Handshake, so you <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/3-ways-other-students-on-handshake-can-help-you\/\" target=\"_blank\">don\u2019t have to job search alone<\/a>! When viewing a job or employer page, you can see students and alumni that have worked there and message them for advice about applications, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-4-most-common-internship-interview-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\">interview questions<\/a>, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is an alum that\u2019s a current employee of the company, send them a brief message introducing yourself, and ask if they\u2019re open to chatting about their job and experience. Share why you\u2019re interested in the company, and tell them you\u2019d like to learn more\u2014instead of mentioning an internship directly. Even if there isn\u2019t a current opening for you, these conversations help build a network of contacts that may be able to help with future openings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Consider alternate work options<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t find an internship now, there are many other ways to gain useful experience. Explore part-time jobs on Handshake so you can start working without a lengthy application and interview process. You also can look for volunteer opportunities at a local non-profit organization, or take on a leadership role with a club on campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers like to see that you\u2019ve had responsibilities outside of the classroom\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be an internship. Be sure to add new work experience to your Handshake profile and highlight the skills developed in your role. Your unique background and skills help <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/sophomore-slump-turned-software-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\">lead the way to that coveted internship<\/a> and first full-time role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, remember that it&#8217;s never too early to start looking for a future internship! Employers will begin posting internships for next semester a few months in advance. Be sure to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">check Handshake often <\/a>for upcoming opportunities
