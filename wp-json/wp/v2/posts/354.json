Just like the title entails, career advisors advise you to make the best decisions for your career and ensure your success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While academic advisors help students find the right major, consider the right career path, set career goals, and ensure their success it\u2019s mainly in the context of their academics. When students ask the inevitable:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><em>\u201cHow do I find a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-highest-paying-entry-level-jobs-in-top-industries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"high-paying entry level job (opens in a new tab)\">high-paying entry level job<\/a>?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><em>\u201cHow do I get a paid internship?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWhat career should I pursue?&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cAnd what do I need to do to get there?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academic advisors kindly refer them to their campus career services center. Sure, an academic advisor may be able to answer <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/7-career-advice-questions-to-ask-your-career-advisor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"these great questions (opens in a new tab)\">these great questions<\/a>, but a dedicated career advisor or career services center will not only have the answers, but tools beyond the scope of an advising appointment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your career advisor can&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Help you match your skills, values, and interests to your career<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The career you eventually pursue should line up with all three! One of the most commonly overlooked attributes when selecting a career is values. Australian psychologist Sabina Read <a href=\"https:\/\/education.stateuniversity.com\/pages\/1813\/Career-Counseling-in-Higher-Education.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"says (opens in a new tab)\">says<\/a>, \u201cvalues are relevant to every domain of our life; from work and managing people, to parenting, decision-making and relationships,\u201d and when values are ignored, we \u201cfeel eroded, frustrated, resentful or empty.\u201d Imagine eight hours a day of that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to dig deep to find a good career fit by yourself.&nbsp; Not all career advisors have access to in-depth assessments, but they can certainly help you evaluate your career needs to find the right career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Teach you the art of interviewing and networking<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019ve never interviewed or you consider yourself an interview guru, no two interviews are the same. A career advisor can help you prepare for <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-4-most-common-internship-interview-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"that next interview\u2019s curveballs (opens in a new tab)\">that next interview\u2019s curveballs<\/a>. They might even be able to set up a mock interview for you with relevant questions to give you an edge over other competitors.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find out about on-campus career fairs and networking events through your career advisor. Let them know if you\u2019re feeling a bit nervous or worried about attending one and they might be able to offer workshops or opportunities to practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Help you write a killer resume and cover letter<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a career services center on campus, you likely have access to Handshake. In addition to helping students <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"find internships (opens in a new tab)\">find internships<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-are-you-doing-after-college\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"plan for life post-graduation (opens in a new tab)\">plan for life post-graduation<\/a>, and connect with other employed students, Handshake provides help with resume and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/mastering-the-internship-cover-letter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cover letter (opens in a new tab)\">cover letter<\/a> writing. Once uploaded, your college\u2019s career advisor or career services center reviews your document and sends feedback to prepare for submission.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many ways you can seek help, and this list is in no way intended to be exhaustive! Check to see what your college can offer you. If they don\u2019t have an on-staff career advisor, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll still have access to campus-wide events, fairs, workshops, and more resources that are just as helpful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A career advisor might just be the person you need to see to decide on your next career step.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034972,"featured_media":360,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_anchor_podcast":"","jetpack_anchor_episode":"","jetpack_anchor_spotify_show":""},"categories":[1360],"tags":[1376,1388,1375,1399],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Finding Your Career Advisor Could Mean Finding Your Career!
