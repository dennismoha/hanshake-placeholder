Recruiters are able to find the right student for the job or internship, no matter what school they attend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a job seeker, this is great news for you. It means you can find your next job or internship without having to rely on multiple in-person meetings with recruiters. How can you utilize Handshake to find a job virtually? Here are four helpful tips from recruiters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Fill out your Handshake profile<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important step to landing a job or internship on Handshake is filling out your profile. Employers are searching for students on Handshake based on the information in their profiles, and messaging candidates with event invites or to encourage them to apply for new job opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why completing your profile, and keeping it up-to-date, is essential. Beyond the basic information like your major and graduation date, make sure to fill out your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-of-your-handshake-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">job interests<\/a>, work experience, skills, courses, and clubs and organizations you\u2019re involved with. The more information you provide, the easier it is for recruiters to find you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Attend virtual events<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers like <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/employers\/how-ibm-is-democratizing-information-for-students-across-the-country\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">IBM<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dXEK835X1mk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Under Armour<\/a> often host virtual events on Handshake to connect with students from across the country. Attending these events is a unique way to meet employees at the companies you want to work for. Virtual events also give you an opportunity to learn more about a company before applying for a job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to check Handshake for new events and sign up for behind-the-scenes tours, coffee chats, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RSoRP0b4uPU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Q&amp;A sessions<\/a>, so you can get an inside look at your next potential employer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>&#8220;Handshake helps us expand our reach and create more meaningful connections with students from all backgrounds.\u201d<\/p><cite>Jeremy Buentello, IBM<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Showcase your soft skills<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, skills are an important part of your Handshake profile. The hard skills you\u2019ve developed in the classroom, at work, or through extracurriculars\u2014such as digital marketing or a programming language\u2014help you stand out to employers looking for students like you. However, don\u2019t forget to include soft skills like communication, problem solving, collaboration, and creativity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent survey of hiring managers, <strong>92 percent <\/strong>said that soft skills matter <em>as much or more<\/em> than hard skills when they&#8217;re hiring.&nbsp; When preparing for an interview, try to think of specific projects or experiences that you can talk about to illustrate <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90463823\/how-to-demonstrate-3-important-soft-skills-during-an-interview\" target=\"_blank\">how you\u2019ve applied these skills<\/a> in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the misconception that you need an engineering background to join a tech company. Sourcing tools on Handshake are crucial for us in connecting with the students who are going to get the most value out of our fellowship.\u201d <\/p><cite>Emily Vogel, Box<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Reply to recruiters ASAP<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, employers sent more than <strong>16 million messages<\/strong> to students on Handshake. Typically, recruiters send messages to invite students to networking events or encourage them to apply for new opportunities. Chatting with a recruiter on Handshake is a great way to make a personal connection to the companies you want to work for, and helps distinguish you from other job candidates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you get a message from a recruiter, make sure to reply as soon as you can. Download the Handshake app in the <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/apple-store\/id1220620171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">App Store<\/a>
