That\u2019s where our &#8220;Step Up Your Profile&#8221; summer challenge comes in. Each week, we&#8217;ll provide you with one easy task to help bring your Handshake to the next level. That&#8217;s it\u2014do just <strong><em>one<\/em><\/strong> thing each week, and you&#8217;ll be beyond prepared by the time fall recruiting begins. \u2060And don\u2019t forget to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joinhandshake\/\">follow us on Instagram<\/a> to get reminders for each week\u2019s task!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re less of a &#8220;live life by the calendar&#8221; type, don&#8217;t worry. The steps below don&#8217;t need to be a strict order of business; you can simply use them as a general guide to completing your profile and optimizing your Handshake experience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 1: Add your spring classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Week one is as easy as pulling up your transcript: just add your classes from the past term to your profile! Recruiters can search for candidates based on completed coursework, so adding Intro to Programming or Business Comms 101 to your roster<em> before<\/em> entering full summer chill mode could pay off come recruitment season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 2: Update your job type preferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Week two of our challenge is all about job types. Make sure to log in and update your Handshake profile with the most accurate job type that you&#8217;re looking for\u2014for new grads, that might mean changing your preference from &#8220;internship&#8221; or &#8220;part-time&#8221; over to &#8220;full-time.&#8221; This is a super simple change that you can make at any time, so be sure that your job type preferences are always reflective of your current wants and needs! And if you have a hard time picking a single job type, don&#8217;t worry: you can select more than one, and we\u2019ll share recommendations for each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 3: Update your current (and future!) location preferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Week three is about location, location, location. Log in and update your Handshake profile with the location(s) where you&#8217;re interested in working, both now and in the future! If you&#8217;re currently searching for <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/internships-in-houston\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">internships in Houston<\/a> and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/internships-in-raleigh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Raleigh<\/a>, but also open to living in <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/internships-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chicago<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/internships-in-philadelphia\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Philadelphia<\/a>, or <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/internships-in-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York City<\/a>, you can include all five in your preferences. This helps employers find you, and ensures that your job recommendations are relevant! And don&#8217;t forget\u2014you can update these preferences at any time, so don&#8217;t be shy about adding cool cities to your list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 4: Update your resume file(s)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Week four is the perfect opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/a-best-practice-approach-to-writing-perfect-entry-level-resumes\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">update your resume<\/a> to reflect your current experience, skills, and organizations. Having a resume ready and uploaded to #JoinHandshake means that you can apply to most jobs in just a few clicks \u2014 simply hit &#8220;apply,&#8221; attach your resume, then submit! \u2060<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re applying to a few different job types or industries, don&#8217;t sweat it \u2014 you can upload multiple resumes to your profile, so don&#8217;t be afraid to customize! That means you can optimize one resume for financial management, one for investment banking, and another one for business administration. When it comes time to apply for jobs, simply choose which resume to attach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 5: Add five skills to your profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week\u2019s task is simple: add five skills to your Handshake profile. Your skills showcase what makes you special, whether it&#8217;s mastery of Photoshop, a knack for social media, a specific programming language proficiency, or something else that you have to offer prospective employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 6: Add a club, organization, or volunteer activity to your profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this week\u2019s challenge, think back on the activities you participated in while on campus. Were you a part of Greek life, a dance troupe, a sports team, a theater group, a cultural heritage union, or maybe a business club? Did you volunteer for any projects in your spare hours? If any of these apply to you, add them to your profile.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 7: Save three interesting jobs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For week seven, we\u2019re going to work on optimizing your recommendations from Handshake. Did you know that the jobs you see at the top of your job and internship listing results (before you <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-the-jobs-you-want-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">enter any keywords<\/a>) are actually our personalized recommendations for you? And these suggestions get even smarter the more you engage with listings, by clicking, saving, and applying. To help train Handshake to surface even better recommended opportunities for you, save a few jobs or internships that are up your alley this week.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 8: Follow a new employer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like last week, week eight\u2019s task will help train the Handshake algorithm to bring you even better recommendations this fall. By following an employer you like, you\u2019re not only letting us know which types of <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-great-companies-to-work-for-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companies you\u2019re interested in<\/a>, but you\u2019ll also get important notifications about that employer. Once you\u2019ve hit \u201cfollow,\u201d you\u2019ll get an email notification when that employer will be hosting or attending an event that you\u2019re eligible to join. You will also be notified when they list a new job for students at your school!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 9: Register for a virtual event<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fall approaches, recruitment will look a bit different. Handshake data shows that most universities will be engaged in a virtual strategy this fall, which means many <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-career-fairs-are-here-next-stop-getting-hired\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">career fairs, interviews, and information sessions<\/a> will be taking place online. Get a head start on connecting with employers online by registering for a virtual event on Handshake this week!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Week 10: Apply for a job or internship<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve spent all summer preparing your Handshake profile for this fall and beyond, it\u2019s time to put your newly stepped-up profile to the test. Apply to a job or internship\u2014or several\u2014this week and get ahead on the fall recruiting season!&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do just one thing each week to
