As adjustments are announced, you might find yourself in the position of needing to find a home off campus\u2026 and want a few folks to share the cost. So, it&#8217;s time to find a college roommate or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all heard roommate horror stories, and let&#8217;s be real: if finding roomies was an easy task, there wouldn\u2019t be so many crazy reality TV shows about folks forced to live under one roof! Luckily, there are many options for college students to find their match(es). And the upsides are huge: you can make some of the best friends of your life when finding somebody to share a college living situation with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting potential roomies IRL is tough in the current climate, so we\u2019ve compiled some pointers for navigating the process, inspired by this robust <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mymove.com\/moving\/guides\/how-to-find-roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roommate guide<\/a> from stress-free moving service <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mymove.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MyMove<\/a>. Using the following tips for finding a college roommate during COVID-19, you\u2019ll get your ideal living situation sorted in no time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Establish a roommate \u201coh-no-no\u201d list<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When trying to sort out who to share your home with for the whole school year, it\u2019s important to keep in mind what you\u2019re looking for in an ideal roommate \u2014 but it\u2019s even more vital to have a list of \u201coh-no-no\u201ds to help you <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/scholarworks.boisestate.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1001&amp;context=pubadmin_facpubs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">avoid potential conflict<\/a>. These shouldn\u2019t be petty things; rather, think about situations that would make or break your relationship with a prospective roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have severe asthma that\u2019s irritated by smoke and smoke residue? Smoking goes on the \u201coh-no-no\u201d list.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Wake up early for your on-campus job and need absolute peace and quiet in the evenings? Late night socializing goes on the \u201coh-no-no\u201d list.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Have a dog or cat that you\u2019re bringing to school this year? Pet allergies go on the \u201coh-no-no\u201d list.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By being up front about these non-negotiable elements of your living situation, it\u2019ll be easier to weed out roomies that won\u2019t be a good fit straight away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take the roommate search online<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now more than ever, it\u2019s helpful to utilize online resources to find a college roommate. Here are some of the internet roommate finder services <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mymove.com\/moving\/guides\/how-to-find-roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recommended by MyMove<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>RoomieMatch:<\/strong> \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.roomiematch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RoomieMatch<\/a> is a dedicated roommate website. Just fill in the basic info, like the terms of the lease and where you\u2019re relocating. (If your city doesn\u2019t match the list of areas the site services, you\u2019re out of luck.) One of the key benefits of RoomieMatch is that they use human profile reviewers to approve web users manually. Complete the signup process, and you\u2019ll receive potential matches. Roommate behavior ratings help you determine quickly who is worth your time \u2014 and who isn\u2019t.\u201d<\/li><li><strong>Diggz:<\/strong> \u201cSign up for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diggz.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Diggz<\/a> to access profiles with deeper information than your typical roommate finder. View how people rate themselves in cleanliness, work, and sleep schedules. Check out a person\u2019s preferred interaction and eating habits. These things can help clue you in to how your roommate situation could play out.\u201d<\/li><li><strong>Roommates:<\/strong> \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.roommates.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roommates<\/a> promises make finding roommates easier than ever. Its Perfect Match system aims to find you the right roommate using shared criteria. On this roommate finder, create your profile and shuffle through the profiles that are sent your way. Then, you can respond to any potential candidates. Even better: It\u2019s free.\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you might not need to utilize one of the services above.<strong> Check out resources specific to your school<\/strong>, such as your campus subreddit, university-specific Facebook groups, your college alumni network, and any resources offered by your campus life \u2014 such as a digital bulletin board for fellow students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prepare a roomie interview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified possibilities for your living situation, make sure to get some face-time in with your prospective roommate(s). Set up a video call, prepare some questions, and prepare to answer some of your own! After all, interviews to determine the right housing situation should go both ways; your maybe-roomie will certainly have concerns of their own to ensure you\u2019re a good fit for them, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the questions that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mymove.com\/moving\/guides\/how-to-find-roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MyMove suggests<\/a> asking during this pre-agreement interview:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you keep your apartment clean, or do you tend to be messy?<\/li><li>Do you have any pets?<\/li><li>How often do you have friends in the apartment?<\/li><li>Do you smoke, use drugs, or drink alcohol?<\/li><li>What do you study?<\/li><li>Do you work?
