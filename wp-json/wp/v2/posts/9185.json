You never know who might be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-a-mentor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">serve as a mentor<\/a>, or help you with an internship or a job in the future. With so many roles asking for more years of work experience than necessary \u2014 or even possible, for many college students \u2014, having another way in is a perk within itself. Having a professional network to pull from can make applications down the road a less tedious process.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take advantage of your alumni network<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Handshake\u2019s most helpful features that students may not know about is the ability to directly chat with alumni from your school. For many students, knowing that someone who attended your university has a job at a desirable company can bring a huge sense of relief. But also knowing <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-get-useful-career-advice-from-other-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you can easily reach out and connect with those graduates<\/a> can provide even more knowledge and exposure to the role that you are applying for. Talking with former students who attended your college can help put your career in perspective, and help push you onto the path you really want to take. Crystal, a student at Oakland University, was actually reached out to by a fellow student for an internship position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe [student] recruiter\u2019s posts understood the fact that we\u2019re still students <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\u2014 it was relatable to me. She understood that while I\u2019m going to give time and effort to the internship, my main focus is still going to be school. She told me in our initial interview that if I ever had an exam coming up, to just let her know and we could work around my school schedule.\u201d<\/p><cite>Crystal, Oakland University<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Find an internship during a Handshake virtual event<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides Handshake\u2019s messaging feature, some students are also finding success networking with alumni at virtual events. In light of COVID and the virtual world it\u2019s promoted, students are taking to Handshake to attend <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/virtual-career-fair-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual career fairs<\/a> and networking chats hosted by their schools. And it\u2019s working! Especially for Marie Robert, senior at College of the Holy Cross, who has been celebrating her success of finding a full-time job through a virtual networking event with some of her college\u2019s alumni.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI used Handshake to go to a networking event with alumni. I actually got in touch with someone from General Electric Healthcare during that call. She was able to connect me with someone in the leadership program that I ended up applying for. Which I am now also going to be working for!\u201d<\/p><cite>Marie, College of the Holy Cross<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Marie was able to get the alumni\u2019s information to touch base after the event. The alumni helped her think of some great interview talking points and generally assisted her in standing out better to her future employer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By clicking \u201cRSVP\u201d for this virtual networking event, Marie was able to get connected \u2014 and now, when January 2022 rolls around, she\u2019ll be working full-time as a member of the Commercial Leadership Program at General Electric Healthcare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those still living in a virtual setting, going to virtual networking events through Handshake can be extremely beneficial. Marie can\u2019t recommend it enough: \u201cIt was really easy to sign up for everything and [the event] had different links to one-on-one chats and group sessions. Handshake really mapped it out well!\u201d So, what are you waiting for?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join other students and find your next internship or full-time job by
