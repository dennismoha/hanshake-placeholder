Not every path will be the same and not every job will be the perfect fit. But taking what you like and what you dislike about a role can be useful in finding that perfect job later. By trying out new jobs or internships, you may learn more about yourself and the job preferences you have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Find out what you don&#8217;t like<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes working a role you don&#8217;t end up loving can actually be helpful in the long run. Handshake user, Sydney Abbate, found a job through Handshake but came to the conclusion that it wasn&#8217;t for her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly when I was meant for, so that was eye opening. I did that [role] for a little while and then realized that sales isn&#8217;t really my speed. But I don&#8217;t think that was not a positive part of my journey. I think that it helped me realize what I don&#8217;t want necessarily from a career which I think can be valuable as well.<\/p><cite>Sydney<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Using your own lived insight can aid you down the line when it comes to applying for other jobs. Down the line, when applying for other jobs, Sydney can take that knowledge about what she doesn&#8217;t like and filter for things she&#8217;s passionate about instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understand what you do like<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, before using Handshake, Hannah Moskowitz wasn&#8217;t sure what field she wanted to go into. As a journalism major, she knew that she would want to work in media, but wasn&#8217;t sure which role. It wasn&#8217;t until an internship in PR and content creation did she realize that a different career might fit her better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>That internship was really my first chance working in social medial, PR, and content creation. And that internship basically set it up so I knew that I wanted to go down a different path\u2013be more strategic communication and less reporting.<\/p><cite>Hannah<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipped with that information and experience, Hannah went on to filter for jobs on Handshake that actually fit her career goals. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not every career path is linear.
