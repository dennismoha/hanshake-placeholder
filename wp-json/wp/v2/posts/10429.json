Ask questions about company culture, open roles, how you might fit in, and anything else that\u2019s on your mind to gain clarity into what exactly you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsure of your career path or what role would be the best fit for you? We suggest getting clarification from the employer you&#8217;re meeting. Here are a few starter questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What\u2019s the day-to-day like for this role, and what responsibilities would I have?<\/li><li>What\u2019s the typical career path for someone starting in this role?<\/li><li>What skills do I need to be successful, and what skills should I start building up now?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers will give you an inside view of what it\u2019s like to work there and offer insights into whether you\u2019d enjoy the culture and the role. Be sure to share your professional goals and interests with the recruiter to help them better understand if you\u2019d be a good fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why should I chat with an employer on Handshake?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers on Handshake are looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/get-to-know-your-future-employer-one-on-one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hire students just like you<\/a>, which is why they\u2019re so eager to connect with you. But taking the time to chat with employers can be beneficial for you too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all heard about the Apples and Googles of the world that seem to have incredible cultures, awesome perks, and are true innovators. But what\u2019s it <em>really <\/em>like to work at these companies\u2014and are there other cool companies out there that you\u2019ve never even heard of? The recruiters or employees you\u2019ll virtually meet with can give you that insider view of their culture, what it means to work at their company, and what roles you\u2019d enjoy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Get comfortable talking about yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While these quick sessions are more like informal conversations, they can be a great way to build your confidence around talking about yourself. Can you describe what you\u2019re looking for, your experience, and your skills in a minute? If not, craft an <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/college-student-elevator-pitch\/\">elevator <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/college-student-elevator-pitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pitch<\/a> and use these one-on-ones as a chance to practice it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you meet with more employers, you\u2019ll build powerful connections. Be sure to leverage these! If there\u2019s a role you\u2019re interested in, ask the employee or recruiter you met with to refer you. Want to meet more employees at that same company? Ask your connection to introduce you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One-one-ones are the perfect way to learn about your career path, get an inside view of your potential employer, and, ultimately, secure your dream job. You\u2019ll be able to practice and perfect your elevator pitch, so when interview time comes around, you nail it.
