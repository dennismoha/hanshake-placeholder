Because classroom academics are typically put on pause for those few months, there\u2019s more time to focus on developing workplace skills. You might even be excited and beginning to search for your summer 2021 internship now! It can initially be intimidating and unfamiliar, but with time your unsure steps will blossom into confidence and clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/tips-for-college-transfer-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">making the decision to transfer schools<\/a> and move across the country from Washington to Michigan, engineering student Kate Evenson was in a time crunch to get ready for the University of Michigan\u2019s career fair. In an effort to organize quickly, she utilized Handshake to help with some <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-get-a-last-minute-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last-minute internship searching<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Catching up for recruiting season<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHandshake helped me to get up to speed in time for the career fair season at the University of Michigan,&#8221; Kate recalls. &#8220;As I was completing my transfer process and moving from Seattle, I was feeling really overwhelmed because the University of Michigan hosts career fairs and interviews as early as the end of the very first week of classes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between packing, moving in, getting adjusted to a new city, <em>and<\/em> finding a summer internship, Kate had a lot on her plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>\u201cNot only did I have to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/tips-for-college-transfer-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">get used to an entirely new university<\/a>, but as a junior, <strong>the pressure was on to nail down a summer internship<\/strong> I felt passionate about to get some valuable experience before looking for a full time position.\u201d<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Through sheer determination, Kate was able to apply to and successfully land a summer internship at <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/accenture-9160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Accenture<\/a> using Handshake\u2019s easy application process.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A summer at Accenture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In her role as a summer consulting analyst, Kate was able to pick up skills that would prove to benefit her later\u2013in life <em>and<\/em> in class. As her summer internship let her work in the worlds of both client and company, she felt increasing validity through her contributions at work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the summer, Kate honed her communication skills and became comfortable presenting her work to leadership. &#8220;That was huge for me,&#8221; she remembers, noting how this lesson helped her overcome imposter syndrome in a historically male-dominated field of study. &#8220;Just having the confidence to know that I belong there is something that I still carry with me in all of my classes.&#8221; \u2060\u2800<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate grew in both technical skills and her awareness of the competence she holds as an <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/engineering-internships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engineer<\/a>. Her summer at Accenture opened the door for more skill growth, networking, and overall career experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/category\/internship-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">right summer internship<\/a> can unlock so many doors when it comes to your career.
