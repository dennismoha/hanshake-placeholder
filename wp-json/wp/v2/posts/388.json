Along with the listed jobs, we\u2019ve also included a short description plus the median annual salary, as determined by the <em>Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Software Engineer<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically computer science graduates, software engineers help create computer programs and mobile applications. Some may develop the core software used to run said computers and mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $105,590&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>Registered Nurse<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered nurses (\u201cRNs\u201d for short) provide patient care, education, and advice in a variety of settings. This role is not constrained to the traditional hospital environment, as nurses can also work in community settings, home healthcare, and even the military. You also don\u2019t need a BSN to become a nurse (an associate\u2019s degree is acceptable) so long as you\u2019re licensed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $71,730<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Salesperson<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSalesperson\u201d is really an umbrella term for the many positions one can seek in sales. There are tons of opportunities, and you can expect just about any industry \u2014 advertising, insurance, real estate, and healthcare tech to name a few \u2014 to have some version of the occupation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $50,450&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. <strong>Teacher<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementary and kindergarten teacher positions are a common choice for recent graduates, because some states will allow graduates with any bachelor\u2019s degree to teach provisionally while obtaining licensure. Teaching the younger generation English, reading, arithmetic, science, and more subjects can be a transitional job or a fulfilling long-term career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $57,980<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. <strong>Accountant<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting usually isn\u2019t enough to land a solid role in accounting, but becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) greatly increases the odds of employment and pay. Accountants keep track of financial records and ensure that taxes are paid accurately. They also ensure the financial integrity of businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $70,500&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>6. <strong>Project Manager<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many self-motivated and organized graduates pursue this versatile role. Similar to sales, project management opportunities exist across a vast span of industries. PMs are tasked with organizing projects and logistics at the onset of new ideas and objectives with a team ready to implement and test said ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $67,280&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>7. <strong>Administrative Assistant<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent decline in popularity hasn\u2019t stopped new college grads from putting administrative jobs in the top 10. Administrative assistants help with clerical duties in office settings including filing, staff support, appointment scheduling, and other tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $38,880<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>8. <strong>Account Executive<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the job that most business students envision when pursuing the major. Just about every company in every industry requires account executives to manage expenses and budgets, implement strategies to achieve territory sales goals, communicate with clients, and analyze business data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): varies from industry to industry, anywhere from $46,000 &#8211; $130,000<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>9. <strong>Financial Analyst<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After account executives, financial analysts are a top choice for business students with a major in finance. Financial analysts often provide advice to corporate and individual investors based on the performance of stocks, bonds, and other forms of investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Median salary (national): $85,660<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>10. <strong>Account Manager<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Look up account management online and you\u2019ll find that there is no one blanket statement to describe the role, as every company does it differently.
