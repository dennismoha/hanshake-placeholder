Congratulations, class of 2020! You&#8217;re going to do amazing things. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Barack Obama: &#8220;Work to build a community.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president of the United States took part in several virtual graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020, including giving the commencement address for the live-streamed <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/hbcustudent.chase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Show Me Your Walk: HBCU Edition,&#8221;<\/a> which celebrated the accomplishments of grads from historically black colleges and universities.

In her commencement speech, Oprah shared the type of inspiration and encouragement that has endeared her to audiences for decades: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You are indeed the chosen class for such a time as this, the Class of 2020. You\u2019re also a united class, the pandemic class, that has the entire world striving to graduate with you. But even though there may not be pomp because of our circumstances, <strong>never has a graduating class been called to step into the future with more purpose, vision, passion and energy and hope<\/strong>. Your graduation ceremony is taking place with so many luminaries celebrating you on the world\u2019s Facebook stage, and I\u2019m just honored to join them and salute you.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/watch-oprah-winfrey-give-commencement-speech-facebook-graduation-1294744\" target=\"_blank\">watch the full speech and #Graduation2020 event here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Christine Cruzvergara: &#8220;Repetition builds reputation.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Handshake VP of Higher Education and Student Success <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/lessons-in-leadership-from-a-handshake-vp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Christine Cruzvergara<\/a> has two simple pieces of advice for the class of 2020. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Repetition builds reputation<\/strong>. &#8220;It&#8217;s your daily actions that make up who you are and how others will remember you. Not the big win, not the huge account you closed, not your awards&#8230; it&#8217;s the combination of everything you do. So how you show up to people everyday, how you answer emails (or don&#8217;t), and how you treat those around you makes a difference.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t discount anyone or anything<\/strong>. &#8220;You never know where wisdom can come from, what you might learn, and who you might end up connecting to again in the future. So pay attention and remember that your everyday actions have a long-lasting impact that could significantly help you (or hurt you).&#8221;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ellen Degeneres: &#8220;Things will get better.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In my life, I\u2019ve been through some incredible highs and some incredible lows, and the one thing that\u2019s true about both of them is that they pass,&#8221; Ellen shared during a virtual commencement speech filmed from her living room. &#8220;<strong>Cherish the good times, and in the bad times remember that they won\u2019t last forever.<\/strong> Things will get better.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iaIsNexUfOE\" target=\"_blank\">watch Ellen&#8217;s full speech here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stephen Curry: &#8220;Invest in the success of others.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During his commencement speech for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/hbcustudent.chase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Chase&#8217;s #ShowMeYourWalk event<\/a>, six-time NBA All-Star Stephen Curry dropped serious wisdom about the importance of community over individual success. After sharing his own experiences learning about teamwork, personal sacrifice, and overcoming fear during college, Curry shared this advice for today&#8217;s grads: \u201cInvest in your community. Invest in the success of others. It\u2019s not about being the only one that succeeds; it\u2019s about multiplying to many.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aKz-jBcBREI\" target=\"_blank\">Steph&#8217;s full commencement speech for the class of 2020 below<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aKz-jBcBREI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Billie Jean King: &#8220;Never stop learning how to learn.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tennis legend and lifelong activist Billie Jean King was one of many notable participants in <em>Her Campus<\/em>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imstillgraduating.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;I&#8217;m Still Graduating&#8221; virtual ceremony<\/a>, which also featured appearances from celebs like the Jonas Brothers, Eva Longoria, and Tamryn Hall.

But for those of us who are able, I&#8217;d encourage you to see if there are also opportunities here to make a difference. Explore problems that are important to you. For me, that problem was clear: the uneven playing field of job opportunities for college students around the country. Think about the steps you might start to take to begin attacking that problem head-on. Your first step might involve enlisting some like-minded friends to help you, applying for a position with a nonprofit, mapping out a business plan, or reaching out to an influential figure for advice\u2026 sometimes, small steps make the biggest impact on the world around you. <strong>Try to channel the uncertainty you\u2019re feeling in this moment into energy that can guide your future.<\/strong>&nbsp;Some of the best innovations of the past were spurred by immense hurdles; I look forward to seeing the way you will change the world based on what you&#8217;re experiencing right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>John Legend: &#8220;Imagine a better future.&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a part of iHeartMedia&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.iheart.com\/Pages\/iheartmedia-commencement-speeches-for-the-class-of-2020.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">commencement speech podcast series<\/a>, EGOT-winner John Legend encouraged today&#8217;s graduates to focus on the positives that have come out of the past several months. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that years from now, when we look back on this unprecedented time, that we <strong>remember not the moments we lost, but the way we rose up together to imagine a better future<\/strong> in which we defined ourselves by love, hope, resilience, and the spirit of community. I hope we remember the ways in which we supported one another; how we made personal sacrifices for the greater benefit of all.
