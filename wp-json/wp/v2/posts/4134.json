For college students, things got extra confusing: final exams happened at home, <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-commencement-speeches-class-of-2020\/\">graduations were put on pause<\/a>, and back-to-school plans became riddled with uncertainty. If internships, summer jobs, and professional development programs weren\u2019t canceled outright, most were moved into a virtual format, ushering in a whole new set of interesting challenges to adapt to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s easy to focus on the many challenges 2020 hath wrought, these unexpected circumstances have ultimately taught the world about the resilience of today\u2019s incoming job-seekers. From childhood bedrooms, shared apartments, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/summer-interns-internship-remote-work-nokia-5g-covid-pandemic-office-reopen-11597768539\">sometimes even parking lots<\/a> across the globe, college students showcased their adaptability while navigating their first professional experiences from behind a screen \u2014 many never actually meeting their managers, new mentors, or peers in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we caught up with students about their summers, it\u2019s clear that they didn\u2019t just \u201csurvive\u201d their virtual professional opportunities&#8230; they thrived. Among the many lessons and pieces of advice they shared, one thing is crystal clear: if you\u2019ve got an open mind, a hunger for learning, and an enthusiasm for new challenges, nothing can put a damper on your summer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, read key takeaways from this summer\u2019s interns, fellows, and remote learners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Be intentional about connecting with colleagues<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStay connected! It\u2019s really easy in an office to stop by someone\u2019s desk. Try to emulate that experience by setting up calls every day to check in with whoever you\u2019re reporting to\u2026 Be proactive. <strong>Set up those meetings, ask those questions, and ask for feedback.<\/strong> Everybody\u2019s willing to help out, you just need to put yourself out there!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CDzL_UCgAkd\/\">Tanya Kapur<\/a>, <em>Business Consulting Intern for a <br>multinational professional services network<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Be proactive about reaching out and talking to people. <\/strong>I think that sometimes it\u2019s really easy when you\u2019re virtual and everything is done through a screen to kind of shrink into the work that you\u2019re doing and just do your own thing. But I\u2018ve found that it\u2019s been so nice to reach out. Asking for 15 minutes of someone\u2019s time \u2014 if they\u2019ve got a cool project that they\u2019ve talked about, or you\u2019re interested in learning more about them and the work they do \u2014 I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s such a great way to make connections and get to know people.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CDj-CjVAlum\/\">Tiffany Liu<\/a>, <em>Civic Digital Fellow for a tech nonprofit<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDuring these times, for remote internships where you don\u2019t have as many natural interactions in the workplace, it\u2019s especially important to reach out to people and talk to them. As long as you\u2019re genuinely respectful and have good intentions,<strong> you\u2019ll be surprised at how receptive people are to your questions<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CEVGSqelceb\/\">Alex Wang<\/a>, <em>Quantitative Research Intern <\/em><br><em>for a hedge fund management firm<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Don\u2019t underestimate the value of teamwork<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned through the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/cushman-wakefield-recommended-reading-list\/\">Virtual Exposure Program this past summer with Cushman &amp; Wakefield<\/a> was to <strong>take pride in the things you accomplish<\/strong>, and none of those accomplishments can be achieved alone. The overall program gave me a great outlook on how the company is very team-oriented and <strong>no projects are truly completed alone<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Michael Apostolopoulos, <em>remote learning series participant<br> with a global commercial real estate firm<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Take advantage of opportunities to learn and grow<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Get involved past whatever work you\u2019re given<\/strong>. For example I got to participate in three of <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/ernst-young-llp-ey-9226\">EY<\/a>\u2019s corporate responsibility programs, and it gave me a better sense for what the company stands for, for its clients and for the community.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Tanya Kapur<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cYour internship is really what you make of it.\u00a0<strong>If you want to learn as much as possible, it\u2019s really up to you<\/strong>\u00a0to talk to as many people as you can and set up those calls.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CDR3VrYnnaN\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cat Dinh<\/a>,\u00a0<em>Inside Sales Intern for a tech company<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cQuite simply, <strong>you get out what you put in<\/strong>&#8230; Since COVID-19 did not allow for hands-on experience this summer, the best tip I could give would be to make it a point to be a sponge and absorb all the information you are taught by these professionals, because it is truly invaluable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Michael Apostolopoulos<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Don\u2019t forget to network, even while virtual!<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPerhaps the most important lesson I learned this summer is that <strong>making connections with people is vital to success<\/strong>. The willingness of <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/cushman-wakefield-15334\">Cushman &amp; Wakefield<\/a> employees to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/cushman-wakefield-recruiter-tips\/\">guide and connect with us<\/a> is an indispensable tool I will treasure for a very long time. In my case, I sometimes found it nerve-wracking to reach out to an older professional because I was scared to take their time and frankly, scared of rejection. However, after this [professional development] series, the saying \u2018you miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take\u2019 has never rung truer and the speakers of the series emphasized that constantly. It\u2019s so important to network with professionals in your industry and although that can seem scary, oftentimes <strong>you\u2019ll find that professionals would more than likely love to help you and see you succeed<\/strong>.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014&nbsp; Sofia Bruno, <em>remote learning series participant <br>with a global commercial real estate firm<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou really want to get to know the company and its culture.

After losing multiple internships this summer, I was sure that all the plans I had for after college were ruined and I found myself losing hope. When I was given the opportunity to participate in C&amp;W\u2019s virtual series, I had no idea how big of a win that would be for me. Suddenly, the pressure that I had put on myself started to feel a lot less heavy. It showed me that while I felt isolated in my losses, I most definitely was not&#8230; <strong>despite how daunting and discouraging the world seems now, if you work hard there is always something to celebrate<\/strong> and this is all just a small part of my journey.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Sofia Bruno<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Your major doesn\u2019t define your career<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>It is the people that drive a company\u2019s success, not their backgrounds.<\/strong> No matter what your first job is or what you majored in during college, everyone can excel in commercial real estate if they work hard and are willing to put in the time to learn.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Michael Apostolopoulos<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Let your personality shine at work<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnother lesson I learned from this series is how important it is to <strong>bring your own personality to the table<\/strong>. After speaking to such a diverse panel of professionals, I learned that there is always a need for a different perspective, a different experience, or a different personality. In a climate where diversity is imperative to a successful workspace, I have found that being a woman from Mexico is one of my greatest qualities and that by embracing these differences I have gained more confidence.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\u2014 Sofia Bruno<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read advice and life lessons from this summer\u2019s virtual interns, digital fellows, and remote learners.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":167034976,"featured_media":4148,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_anchor_podcast":"","jetpack_anchor_episode":"","jetpack_anchor_spotify_show":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[1490,1369,1575],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What\u2019d You Learn This Summer?
