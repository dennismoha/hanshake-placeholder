Nearly 3,000 Goldman Sachs Interns Weigh In"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>2020 has been such a wild ride that nearly every day this year prompted the question, &#8220;What next?&#8221; Indeed, when COVID-19 led to campus and business closures, state-enforced shelter in place, and many canceled plans, college students felt a heavy impact. As many said goodbye to friends and trekked back to childhood bedrooms with no return to normalcy in sight, one might have expected a dreary experience and turnout for summer interns. Thankfully, this was far from true. We\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/remote-internship-advice-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">heard from many 2020 interns<\/a> that, even remotely, their summers were full of valuable professional learning experiences that have sparked their careers. Nearly 3,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/careers\/students\/programs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> summer analysts and associates were just as optimistic!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year, the leading global financial services firm surveys its summer intern class to learn more about their experiences and predictions for the future. 2020 was no exception, despite 71% of summer interns joining from their homes instead of New York City, London, S\u00e3o Paulo, and other Goldman Sachs branches around the world. Thanks in part to Goldman Sachs\u2019s Handshake Premium partnership, this year\u2019s intern class consisted of over 2,700 summer analysts and 129 summer associates, who represented 54 majors from nearly 500 universities. The poll asked interns to weigh in on fun topics, like their social media platforms of choice\u2014the vast majority favor Instagram and only 23% use TikTok\u2014as well as more serious topics, like the impact they believe virtual work will have on their generation\u2019s future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remote work isn\u2019t going anywhere&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A majority 63% of interns surveyed believe that COVID-19 will lead to increased remote work options and lasting professional flexibility. This positive sentiment toward a virtual future is undoubtedly due to the positive experience described in many of <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/goldman-sachs-14072\/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the reviews left by interns<\/a> who worked remotely: \u201cGoldman Sachs did a wonderful job giving the interns the best experience possible without being in office. The projects I was given to work on really gave me a sense of what I would be doing if I were a full-time employee.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite great experiences during their virtual summer at Goldman Sachs, 75% of the respondents fear that remote work and school will negatively impact their relationships; a concern echoed in <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/college-students-mental-health-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a recent Handshake survey about mental health<\/a>. Perhaps that\u2019s why video calls are so important: 64% of the intern class prefers connecting face-to-face through video, instead of talking on the phone.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>COVID-19 has made priorities crystal clear<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More than half of Goldman Sachs\u2019s interns say that they\u2019re spending less and saving more in the wake of COVID-19, prioritizing their finances more effectively than they might have without the economic uncertainty of a pandemic. But money isn\u2019t everything!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about their top concerns while looking for their next role, salary fell behind the employer\u2019s core mission. In a year when organizations were defined by their stances on important topics like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/our-firm\/people-and-culture\/racial-equity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">racial equity<\/a>, it\u2019s no surprise that college students want to work for companies that contribute to an important cause. Here are their top reported concerns for future jobs, in order:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Advancement opportunities<\/li><li>Nature of day-to-day work<\/li><li>Colleagues<\/li><li>Employer having an important purpose<\/li><li>Salary<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious about other findings, like the proportion of \u201ccat people\u201d versus \u201cdog people\u201d among Goldman Sachs\u2019 intern class?
