A beloved family pet or an unforgettable field trip experience could inspire a whole career path for some! The great thing about a career revolving around animals is the variety of things you can become! Seek within this article for tips on how to secure your animal-centered dream internship!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What does an animal intern do?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the site you choose to intern at, your animal internship could look like many different things. If you\u2019re more interested in the science and procedural side of things, a research or veterinary internship might have you in the lab more. However, if you want a more hands on experience with a wider variety of animals, a zoology internship might be more appealing! And in that case your animal internship will consist of familiarizing yourself with the zoo\u2019s animals and their daily routines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How do I find an animal internship?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering how to get an internship working with animals for summer 2021, try looking on<a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/login?_ga=2.197960807.978763090.1615926285-1442318662.1608606090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Handshake<\/a> under filtered searches like \u201canimal internships near me.\u201d Handshake allows you to focus on employers you want to work for and even network with past interns who may also be alumni from your school. And if you\u2019re looking for an animal internship in a particular location for summer 2021, try searching for openings by using filters like \u201canimal care internships\u201d or \u201czoology internships.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How do I get an animal internship with no experience?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in getting an animal internship, but have no prior experience, it\u2019s key to play to your strengths and show employers that you\u2019re eager to learn. You can search for animal related internships on Handshake to first get a feel of the requirements they usually list for internships. After that, list your resume and cover letter experiences and previous roles you\u2019ve had where the skills translate over. For example, if you\u2019ve taken a biology or zoology course or have had experience in an applicable school project, mention it and how it relates to your desired role!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>When should I start applying for animal internships?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For most positions, start searching for your internship sooner rather than later! If you are planning to have a summer animal related internship, we recommend starting to look for internship positions no later than the season prior. Many industries prefer to recruit as early as the fall, so staying up to date on fall virtual career fairs will be helpful in securing a role! Each company has different deadlines for applications, so sooner is usually better! If you\u2019re searching for a role during the school year, it\u2019s best to get on applying 3-6 months prior so you can inform your internship of your other obligations and classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also really important to keep in mind that your university\u2019s career services center will have great insight about specific recruitment periods at your school. Make sure to sign up for a meeting with your career advisor at the start of the school year for additional help in planning ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How much do animal interns make?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the internship roles that require animal care interns vary, there\u2019s no standard answer for an animal internship payscale. If you\u2019re wondering how much your animal internship will pay, it might be best to inquire directly with the company you\u2019re considering taking an internship with.. Some internship programs will offer only class credits, while many others are more keen to compensate their interns with an hourly rate or a set stipend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What skills are relevant for animal interns?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ability to stay calm under pressure<\/li><li>Background in biology and zoology<\/li><li>Strong teamwork skill<\/li><li>Organized and prepped<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where do animal interns work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Animal interns can take their learnings and work into a few different roles like <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.joinhandshake.com\/students\/job-role-animal-scientists\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Animal Scientists<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.joinhandshake.com\/students\/job-role-veterinary-assistants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Veterinary Assistants<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.joinhandshake.com\/students\/job-role-veterinarians\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Veterinarians<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.joinhandshake.com\/students\/job-role-zoologists\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zoologists<\/a>.
