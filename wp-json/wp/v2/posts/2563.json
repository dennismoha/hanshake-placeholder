New York is known for finance, media, and fashion internships and has a rich and vibrant theater, art, and intern scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer internships provide you with many valuable experiences, giving a real taste of what it\u2019ll be like to work in your preferred industry down the line. You\u2019ll connect with potential mentors, learn trade secrets, and build relationships with coworkers with a range of expertise. Internships beef up resumes, provide valuable avenues to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-secure-a-letter-of-recommendation-from-your-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\">letters of recommendation<\/a>, and can even <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-turn-your-internship-into-full-time\/\" target=\"_blank\">turn into full-time jobs<\/a>. If you consider all of these perks of interning and add the benefit of exploring a diverse city that\u2019s full of opportunities, you have a very compelling list of reasons to intern in New York City.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tips for your resume and profiles<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you get started on sending out applications, make sure that you have your resume up to date and have fully filled out all <a href=\"http:\/\/joinhandshake.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your Handshake profile<\/a> details. With a complete profile, an impressive New York City internship is more attainable than ever. Recruiters are much more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-wow-recruiters-that-message-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">message a student<\/a> with a complete profile that says you want to work in NYC than an unfinished one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tips for your internship interview<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do land your first interview, be it a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-make-a-good-impression-in-a-virtual-job-interview\/\">virtual interview<\/a> or in person, make sure to come prepared and dressed to impress. Review your resume and cover letter to make sure you have specific examples of your experience to share, from clubs or coursework. You can even schedule a mock interview with your university\u2019s career center or, if you\u2019re tight on time, ask a trusted friend to grill you on <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-4-most-common-internship-interview-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some common interview questions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tips for networking at your internship<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve landed an internship in New York and settled into the flow of day-to-day life at the office, start chatting with your coworkers. Whether they\u2019re industry professionals or fellow interns, it\u2019s important to treat them with equal respect. You never know what insights they could lend, or who could be a valuable connection down the line, five or ten years from now. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your new colleagues out for quick coffee chats, or request 15-minute informational interviews about their career trajectory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Want more tips for getting the most out of your internship?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for specific advice before your internship begins?
