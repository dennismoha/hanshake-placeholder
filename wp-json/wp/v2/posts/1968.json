The messaging feature on Handshake gives you a direct line to nearly <strong>six million <\/strong>active students and recent alumni who are job searching, interning, or have landed their first full-time job. This network is a great resource for you to get useful advice about interviews, internships, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Making your profile visible to other students<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before sending a message, you must make your profile visible to other students and alumni. To do this, go to the<strong> Settings &amp; Privacy<\/strong> section of your profile and select the <strong>Community<\/strong> option. This also makes your profile visible to employers, so recruiters will be able to find you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry\u2014your profile will never be visible to employers that aren\u2019t approved by your school, or to anyone outside of the Handshake network. You also can change your privacy settings at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Finding students you want to message<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several ways to find students and alumni that can help you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On the <strong>Students page<\/strong>, you can search for students by school year, major, previous employers, and student organizations.&nbsp;<\/li><li>When you click on <strong>an employer page<\/strong>, you\u2019ll see students who have worked there, and can tell you more about company culture, internship projects, and more.<\/li><li>You\u2019ll also find <strong>student reviews<\/strong> on an employer\u2019s page. You\u2019ll see a Message button on the review if that student is open to talking more about their experience.&nbsp;<\/li><li>On the <strong>Q&amp;A page<\/strong>, you can find students who\u2019ve asked or answered a question, and reach out to them for more information.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll see a blue Message button on the profiles of students and alumni who have indicated they\u2019re open to chatting with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What can you ask other students about?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you open a message, you\u2019ll be asked to choose the topic of your question. The topics are: Professional Experience,&nbsp; Education Recommendations, Resume Advice, Interview Advice, Reviews or Q&amp;A, and Other Career Related Topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Professional Experience. <\/strong>Search for someone who has interned or works at a company you\u2019re interested in, and ask them about company culture, intern projects and more.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Education Recommendations. <\/strong>Find out the best courses to take to prepare for a particular career. Or ask a graduate school student about their work, professors, and experience if you\u2019re thinking about applying.<\/li><li><strong>Resume Advice.<\/strong> Learn what to include on your resume that best highlights your courses, projects and unique experience.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Interview Advice. <\/strong>Gain insight into a company\u2019s interview questions and process.<\/li><li><strong>Reviews or Q&amp;A. <\/strong>Ask for more information on a student\u2019s review or Q&amp;A question.<\/li><li><strong>Other Career Related Topic.<\/strong> Ask any other career-related question.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After you&#8217;ve selected the topic of your question, you\u2019ll see a customizable template to help you draft your message. Or, you can clear the template text if you prefer to write your own. You\u2019ll get an email notification when the student answers your question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll also get a notification if another student reaches out to you for advice! You have the option to accept or decline a message. After you accept the message, you&#8217;ll be able to respond. If you decline, you&#8217;ll get a prompt asking why you&#8217;re declining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tip: You can report a message if it violates Handshake&#8217;s messaging guidelines. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the messaging page, and you\u2019ll see the option to flag the message.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The students and alumni on the Handshake network are a great resource for you as you search for your next job or internship.
