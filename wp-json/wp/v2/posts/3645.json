This thoughtfully curated series of life lessons touched on meaningful topics like fostering connection through good communication, and demonstrating resilience during challenging circumstances like COVID-19. One July session, entitled \u201cPowering Your Mindfulness,\u201d focused on utilizing mindfulness practices to manage stress, bring balance to workdays, and care for your mental health at work.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for this mindfulness course, Eaton encouraged its interns to read <em>Harvard Business Review<\/em>\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/03\/how-to-get-through-an-extremely-busy-time-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cHow to Get Through an Extremely Busy Time at Work\u201d<\/a> and watch <em>Big Think<\/em>\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ywp4vaFJASE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dan Harris&#8217; Panic Attack (and Discovery of Meditation)<\/a>.\u201d This prep material provides advice that can benefit any young professional!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, learn four ways to manage stress and practice mindfulness during your internship. Plus, don\u2019t forget to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.joinhandshake.com\/employers\/eaton-10215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">follow Eaton on Handshake<\/a> to learn more about exciting job and internship opportunities with the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block time for mental rest<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first article from Eaton\u2019s list recommends not trying to fill every spare moment with productive activity, but rather allowing a few moments to breathe during the workday. Instead of taking the two minutes between Zoom meetings to frantically write an email, <em>HBR<\/em> says: \u201cConsider using brief waiting times for true mental breaks. Take some slow breaths, drop your shoulders, and just chill.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easier said than done, but don\u2019t underestimate the value of deep breathing and a few minutes away from your screen to recalibrate if you\u2019re feeling frantic during your internship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compartmentalize big tasks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than letting a large to-do list task overwhelm you, think about it in segments\u2014and, <em>HBR<\/em> recommends, think of a positive element to each segment. For example, if you\u2019ve got to tackle creating a large Powerpoint presentation for your manager, consider breaking it up in your mind (and your calendar):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Outline the presentation info&nbsp;<\/li><li>Build the slides&nbsp;<\/li><li>Edit and double-check any figures&nbsp;<\/li><li>Review with manager<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, one big task that felt insurmountable is now four smaller, simpler to-do list items to check off.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Practice mindfulness meditation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ywp4vaFJASE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <em>Big Think<\/em> video above, journalist and television anchor Dan Harris shares his experience with anxiety that led to discovering mindfulness meditation. After his experience grappling with a nationally televised panic attack, Harris founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tenpercent.com\/mindfulness-meditation-the-basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ten Percent Happier<\/a>, an app to help teach the basics of meditation to skeptics. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/10percenthappier.app.link\/install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">try it free<\/a> to learn the basics of mindfulness meditation, including how to deal with thoughts, discomfort, and emotions that might arise during meditation. There are also plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZToicYcHIOU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free, guided mindfulness meditations available on YouTube<\/a> from reputable organizations like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.calm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Calm<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Work smarter, not harder&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Harvard Business Review<\/em> recommends implementing Premack\u2019s Principle into your day to make it less stressful and more pleasurable. \u201cPremack\u2019s principle (as it applies here) is to use an easier behavior as a reward for a harder behavior,\u201d reads Eaton\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/03\/how-to-get-through-an-extremely-busy-time-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">suggested article<\/a>. Organize your day by alternating between tasks that intimidate you and simple tasks you enjoy.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a social media marketing intern, you might feel stressed when drafting reports on monthly analytics for each social channel. Find another easy task you enjoy to immediately follow the report-writing; it might be whipping up a cool graphic for Instagram, or collecting pretty visual inspiration on Pinterest to help build a campaign moodboard. By giving yourself this reward in the form of work that still helps you whittle away your to-do list, you\u2019ll help balance the stress of your internship in a positive way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most incredible jobs can have their stressful moments, especially with the added complexities of a global pandemic. But with the right techniques to manage your time and response to your new internship environment, you can emerge stronger and happier! As they say, pressure makes diamonds.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn four ways to balance your days and practice mindfulness as an
