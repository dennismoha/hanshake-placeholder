If you\u2019re considering a role in the field of psychology, then you\u2019re definitely not alone in your interests. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/programs\/coe\/indicator_cta.asp\">National Center for Education Statistics<\/a>, majoring in psychology is among the top five choices for undergraduates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be attracted to the versatility and customization this path offers, or simply want to satisfy your curiosity. No matter your motivation, majoring in psychology can equip you with skills for your future career, opening the doors to research, counseling, lab management, and many more careers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Psychology Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychology, defined as the study of the mind and behavior, pertains to humans and all of their intricacies. To intern in roles related to psychology, it\u2019s important to consider which skills might help you succeed.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such skill is communication.

Not only does this quality aid your own personal relationships, but it also widens your perspective and allows for better critical thinking. If you\u2019re working with people from different backgrounds or other age groups, having a holistic view of human connection is extremely beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up ahead, explore some psychology internships that you might be interested in pursuing in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.
