However, your chances of having a plan before you graduate increase significantly when you invest your free time wisely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Create Your Handshake Account<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\">If your university has a career services center<\/a>, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve heard of Handshake.
