So, how can you be ready to land your next job or internship virtually this year? Follow these steps to make the most of your online job hunt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Complete your Handshake profile<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is always our first piece of advice for student job seekers, because your profile is fundamental to getting hired on Handshake. Employers are searching for students to recruit based on the information in their profiles such as <strong>major, graduation date, <\/strong>and<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-on-your-handshake-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>interests<\/strong><\/a> (<strong>job type, cities, roles<\/strong>). And you can highlight all of the things that make you uniquely qualified including your <strong>courses, organizations, work experience <\/strong>and <strong>skills<\/strong>. When you complete your profile, you\u2019ll be more likely to receive direct messages from employers inviting you to events or to apply for jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is crafting your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-new-grad-resume-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resume<\/a> with the information included in your profile. Upload and save your resume to your Handshake account so it\u2019s ready when you&#8217;re applying to jobs. You can upload more than one version of your resume\u2014so consider adapting it for different roles that you want to apply for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Start networking online<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard that networking is important, and it can sound a bit intimidating. But \u201cnetworking\u201d really just means making a connection with someone from your school, extracurriculars, volunteer groups\u2014or just reaching out to someone you don\u2019t know who shares the same professional interests. There are many different ways to start networking online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find alumni of your school on Handshake who have or had roles that you\u2019re interested in and send them a message. Introduce yourself and tell them you\u2019d like to learn more about their experience. Ask them a question you have about their organization or how they began their career. And don\u2019t forget to thank them in advance for connecting and sharing their advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try looking for online professional interest groups to make connections with people in the fields that you&#8217;re exploring. It may take some research; you can also reach out to your professors or club leaders for their suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Stay up-to date on employers&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you see an employer on Handshake that you like, click the Follow button on their page. If you\u2019re on the Handshake app, click the star button. Following employers on Handshake is so useful because you\u2019ll receive email alerts when they post new jobs and events. Plus, it helps improve your job recommendations. The more you explore and follow <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-great-companies-to-work-for-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">employers you\u2019d like to work for<\/a>, the more relevant your recommendations become.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can set search engine alerts for your top employers and follow their social media accounts. These are easy ways to learn about new initiatives, jobs, and other notable updates on their organization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Attend virtual recruiting events<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest opportunities to connect with employers this year is at <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-career-fairs-are-here-next-stop-getting-hired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtual events on Handshake<\/a>. Employers are hosting group and 1:1 sessions to give students a look at their organizations and to recruit for open jobs and internships. Be sure to check your email for event announcements and log in often to see upcoming events for students at your school. You\u2019ll also be notified when employers you follow are attending virtual fairs on Handshake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you register for a virtual fair, you can sign up early for sessions with the employers you want to meet and learn more about\u2014a major advantage over traditional career fairs. Don\u2019t miss these prime recruiting opportunities!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Read our <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/attending-a-virtual-career-fair-here-are-10-tips-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">guide to virtual events<\/a>, with tips and tricks to know before you attend.<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Practice for virtual interviews<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like in-person interviews, it takes some practice to get comfortable with virtual interviews. This is the time to call in some reinforcements. Ask a friend or family member to help you practice. Start with your \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/college-student-elevator-pitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">elevator pitch<\/a>\u201d\u2014a brief introduction about you, your background and career goals. Then have them ask you a few <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-4-most-common-internship-interview-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">common interview questions<\/a> and ask them for any feedback on your answers. While you don\u2019t need to memorize exactly what you\u2019ll say, it\u2019s very important to get more comfortable answering interview questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out our post with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-make-a-good-impression-in-a-virtual-job-interview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>more ways to impress employers<\/em><\/a><em> during a virtual interview.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Chat with your career center<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your school\u2019s career center staff are an incredible resource, so take advantage of their knowledge. They can answer your job and internship questions, help you craft your resume and cover letters, or even practice for virtual interviews. They also have insight on employers that are hiring at your school and those that may have strong alumni networks. Call your career center and schedule an appointment\u2014they\u2019ll be happy to help you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Apply apply apply<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t get a job if you don\u2019t apply, right? It may go without saying, but you\u2019ll greatly increase your chances of getting hired if you apply to a lot of open jobs. And try to keep an open mind, especially if you\u2019re not quite sure what you want to do. Now is the time to gain different experiences and learn what you do and don\u2019t like about a job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily Handshake will surface recommendations based on your profile, to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-the-jobs-you-want-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">find the jobs you want<\/a> to apply for. Once you have your profile filled in and resumes uploaded, you\u2019ll be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-apply-for-jobs-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">apply to many jobs<\/a> on Handshake in just a few clicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Be proactive and follow up<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter where your job search takes you, be consistent and follow up. Whether it&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-wow-recruiters-that-message-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">message from an employer<\/a>, an application, virtual event or interview\u2014always consider three p\u2019s: be <strong>proactive, prompt <\/strong>and <strong>polite<\/strong>. For interviews, whether informational or for an open job, it\u2019s best practice to send a thank you note within 24 hours. In your thank you note, share something specific that you enjoyed learning or talking about, and reiterate your interest in the job, career path, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you discussed an open job or internship with an employer during a virtual event, make sure to apply as soon as possible. If the employers shared their contact information with you, send them a note thanking them and letting them know you\u2019ve applied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your online actions are especially important when recruiting is virtual. If you can\u2019t make a great impression in person, it\u2019s best to be extra responsive and appreciative to the connections you make online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a
