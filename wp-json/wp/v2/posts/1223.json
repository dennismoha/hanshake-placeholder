You won\u2019t be the only one applying. There\u2019s a good chance that many students with similar experiences and educational backgrounds will apply to the same position(s) you\u2019re considering. Additionally, the nature of the position predisposes the company to some risk. It\u2019s as new of a venture for the company as it is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your cover letter needs to go beyond simply persuading the hiring manager. It needs to speak to their need of a candidate ready for a smooth transition. It needs to assuage any doubts they may have about you as an outside hire. A cover letter that hooks and satisfies the reader\u2019s needs will go a long way in differentiating you as a prospect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Format is crucial when writing a strong entry level job cover letter. It <a href=\"https:\/\/owl.purdue.edu\/owl\/subject_specific_writing\/professional_technical_writing\/basic_business_letters\/index.html\">should be in business letter format<\/a>, which means:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>All text is left justified<\/li><li>The top should include your name, phone number, and email<\/li><li>Then the date of application<\/li><li>Then the information for the job you\u2019re applying to<\/li><li>Every body of text that follows should be separated by one line<\/li><li>Your end closure and signature should be separated by four lines<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Your intro format should look like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark \u00c9tienne<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">(xxx) xxx-xxx<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">met35@example.com<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">June 6, 2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Marketing Assistant<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Job ID: 5467382<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">NTN Marketing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the time to find out who the hiring manager for the role is. While listing the position as the recipient in this letter is sufficient, you\u2019ll score bonus points for your diligence if you can cater the letter to that person. It\u2019s worth the effort when you can include recipient information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Greeting<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\u2019s one portion of the cover letter that shouldn\u2019t stand out, it\u2019s the greeting. Keep it simple. Keep it professional. <em>Dear Emily, <\/em>is ideal. If the hiring manager has a doctorate (PhD or equivalent) address them respectively (i.e., \u201cDear Dr. Simmons,\u201d). If you don\u2019t have a name, you can use \u201c<em>Dear Hiring Manager<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The Hook<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard the common datum on attention span, that the average is no more than 8 seconds. You should assume the same for hiring managers sifting through hundreds of applications. If your opener isn\u2019t compelling enough, your cover letter may end up in the wrong pile. Stick to a style that garners attention, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My previous internship experience taught me that a marketing assistant is more involved than just analyzing and compiling customer data. Coffee and breakfast in hand, I spent my mornings compiling comprehensive competitive analyses based on our available data. My afternoons, looking for supplemental data to provide a stronger analysis. Every deliverable contained the necessary information to help the marketing team develop a better product for their clients. I took pride in my work, knowing that I was a part of the team that helped the company retain 80% of its clientele.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll notice several elements in this paragraph that help keep the reader engaged, and also add value to the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The narrative is written in a conversational, yet formal tone<\/li><li>It contains some imagery and strategically paints a scenario<\/li><li>There is data; something that reflects the writer\u2019s involvement in their past internship\u2019s success<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>The skills<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next task is to garner interest from the reader. Give them an idea of your potential and what you may be capable of while working for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One year of internship experience at XYZ Branding has granted me the skills necessary to hit the ground running on day one. If given the opportunity, your company can benefit from the intern who previously:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Provided written marketing ad materials boasting a minimum 11% conversion rate<\/em><\/li><li><em>Helped design focus group environments that maximize accuracy and data reliability<\/em><\/li><li><em>Helped conduct the in-depth market research in the industry<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is everything. Be specific in any projects you worked in that led to any significant results. Use detailed percentages wherever possible. Also notice the lack of <em>I statements<\/em>. This is the easiest section to fall into an \u201cI\u201d trap. The more you say \u201cyou\u201d and express how you can benefit the company, the less you have to try to convince them with the things \u201cI\u201d did.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The fit<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, your hiring manager will want to know how you fit in their company. They want to know that you will be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/lou-adler\/competency-is-not-enough-job-fit-is-key-to-better-hiring-decisions.html\">intrinsically motivated in doing your work<\/a>, without needing significant direction. Research the company, really understand their needs, and take the following approach to instill desire in your talent:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>As a passionate, results-driven individual, I am as dedicated as a company needs their best employee to be. I am aware that NTN Marketing is one of the leading marketing brands in the North East. And a company like yours can help create a mutually beneficial relationship with an employee who is ready for any undertaking.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the job description goes out of its way to request hard-working, reliable candidates, then don\u2019t sell yourself short. Let them know that you\u2019ll be a great fit for the unique working environment they provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The call to action<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Always end your cover letter with a strong call to action. Reminding the reader to reach out to you is crucial to ending up on the shortlist.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I would love to have the opportunity to further discuss my potential in working at NTN Marketing. Can we schedule a future date to discuss how I can help with your clients X Imaging, Y Tiling, and Z Construction?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call to action is also a great space to namedrop on any specific information you may have researched about the company. Letting them know how you can benefit them in one of their existing projects, for example, shows that you are ready to start right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The closer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gratitude is powerful and can go a long way. Thank the reader for taking the time to read the 100th cover letter for the day. They\u2019ll remember that. It can be similar to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kind regards,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike \u00c9tienne<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Full example: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for the cover letter example you can use when starting your own from scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark \u00c9tienne<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(xxx) xxx-xxx<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>met35@example.com<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>June 6, 2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear Dr. Rojas,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My previous internship experience taught me that a marketing assistant is more involved than just analyzing and compiling customer data.
