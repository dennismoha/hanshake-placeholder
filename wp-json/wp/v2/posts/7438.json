Just ask Dalvin! \u201cGetting the first internship can be the toughest thing in the world. It\u2019s like a chicken and egg scenario, because you are trying to get experience through the internship, but need experience to secure the role,\u201d he says. \u201cTherefore, in trying to land my first internship, I was willing to join any company that would give me the time of day. Luckily for me, that company just so happened to be an awesome tech company by the name of Facebook. With Facebook on my resume, it made seeking other internships down the line a lot more interesting.\u201d Soon after completing the internship, Dalvin found himself faced with several offers from companies who wanted to bring him on board.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to decide between job offers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, choosing a job or internship offer boils down to your preference. However, here are a few helpful tips that will help you weigh the pros and cons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Don\u2019t make a rash decision.<\/strong> \u201cWithout seeing what\u2019s out there,\u201d Dalvin says, quickly accepting your first offer \u201ccan leave you at a disadvantage because you won\u2019t know if you\u2019re being paid at a competitive rate. You could end up being grossly underpaid, finding that only after hearing from your peers at other companies what they were getting paid.\u201d When you receive an offer, politely inquire about what the employer\u2019s desired timeline is for a final answer. Be sure to use your remaining time strategically to evaluate your options based on the following criteria. (Don\u2019t be afraid to make some old-fashioned pro and con lists!)<\/li><li><strong>Think about what really matters to you.<\/strong> Sure, it might be tempting to automatically accept the highest salary\u2014after all, student loans are no joke\u2014but there are other factors that might play into which role will make you feel most fulfilled at work. What projects would you focus on in each role? Will you have opportunities for upward mobility and professional growth? Is the company located somewhere you\u2019re interested in living?<\/li><li><strong>Consider which environments you thrive in.<\/strong> Are you more inclined toward a smaller environment versus a large, complex organization? Do you like the idea of a close-knit, collaborative team or a very focused position within a larger infrastructure? Do you want to work remotely or in a hybrid environment, or do you have your heart set on in-person work? All of these factors should be considered when you\u2019re weighing your options!<\/li><li><strong>Take note of the benefits.<\/strong> When considering an offer, think about the full range of benefits you\u2019re being offered, not simply the salary number. What does the paid vacation time look like? Does the company offer retirement matching or stock options? What caliber of healthcare, dental, and vision benefits might they extend? Are there additional perks, such as fitness memberships, tuition reimbursement, or a home office stipend? A comprehensive benefits package can quickly add up to create a lucrative offer, even if there are larger salaries on the table.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Get the real scoop on company culture.<\/strong> Consult <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/3-ways-other-students-on-handshake-can-help-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake reviews<\/a> to learn more about past employees\u2019 experiences at a company. This is a simple way to get the tea on what to expect from an employer when it comes to stress-level, work-life balance, DE&amp;I (diversity, equity, and inclusion) efforts, and more.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ask for help<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself in Dalvin\u2019s shoes, be sure to reach out to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your school\u2019s career services center<\/a>, where the advisors on staff will be thrilled to help you weigh your options and draft professional responses.
