Maybe you just need some career answers before <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/what-career-is-right-for-me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"making a decision (opens in a new tab)\">making a decision<\/a>. Wherever you may find yourself in your career path, be prepared with these career advice questions to help guide the discussion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What can I do with my major?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, the answer to this question may seem obvious, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. You might be surprised at the flexibility and transferable skills that most degrees can offer. Not all psychology majors end up as psychologists; for example, some pursue marketing, PR, human resources, or other careers that require strategic communication. The same can be said for civil engineers who become great managers in the construction field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How should I write my resume and cover letter?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the career you\u2019re pursuing and your experience, there are different ways to approach your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/mastering-the-internship-cover-letter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cover letter (opens in a new tab)\">cover letter<\/a> and resume. Plus, a resume is your employer\u2019s first impression of you, making this skill imperative to perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What should I expect from my next interview?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to impress your hiring manager during your next interview, you need to know which questions to expect and how to answer them. If you need help practicing those answers, your advisor may offer mock interviews or refer you to workshops available from your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/from-career-services-to-career-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"career services (opens in a new tab)\">career services<\/a> center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How can I improve my online presence?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When submitting your job application, you can expect a prospective employer to run an online search of your social accounts. According to <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/2377-social-media-hiring.html\" target=\"_blank\">CareerBuilder,<\/a> <\/em>70 percent of employers use social media during the screening process. The fact that 47 percent of employers wouldn\u2019t hire a candidate with no social media presence makes social media a double-edged sword. You don\u2019t need to guess what your employers want to see on your social media \u2014 seek advice in this area to ensure that your online presence, including your Handshake profile, is both accessible <em>and<\/em> professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Where can I find a job\/internship in my field?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for career advice, this should be one of your go-to questions. Your career services center most likely has opportunities available via Handshake, but every college is different in their on-campus and virtual resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How can I master networking?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is rarely as easy as it seems, but it might be one of the most important skills you can master before jumping into the professional world. Handshake provides many peer-to-peer networking opportunities if on-campus networking options are limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>When can I schedule my next appointment?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t expect to make large strides in your career path overnight. Make it a habit to confer with someone you can trust to offer good advice to make your transition into employment as seamless as possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Important career questions every student needs answers
