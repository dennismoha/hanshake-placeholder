For example, voice actors don\u2019t need makeup or costumes, but actors going to shoot in front of the camera do. Usually you\u2019ll arrive to set for your call, which can be anywhere from late at night or early in the morning. Depending on the day, you could be blocking your scenes, rehearsing lines, or actually performing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What advice would you give someone that is trying to break into acting?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: As a new actor, it&#8217;s important that you build a reel\/portfolio. If you want to one day have an agent that represents you, it\u2019s key to have examples of your work for them to pitch and distribute. Try getting involved in some student films around your school to start building a portfolio and gain experience at the same time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn about the
