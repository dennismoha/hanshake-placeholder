In entry-level jobs you can network with coworkers, find career mentors, and figure out where exactly your career passions lie. There\u2019s something new to learn every day, which makes working an entry-level job so much more exciting and stimulating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entry-level jobs are also great places to assess what roles in your industry you\u2019re particularly interested in. Don\u2019t be afraid to try out different roles that might not align completely with your major\u2013you could find something exciting in another applicable job if you do! Diversify the companies you apply to and the roles you hold to expand your vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is an entry-level job?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An entry-level job is a position that requires minimal to no previous experience in a professional field. That also makes it easier to break into other entry-level jobs in various professions\u2013just meet the basic qualifications listed on the posting and show your hunger to learn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the best entry-level jobs?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the industry you want to work in later, consider applying to entry-level jobs that will give you foundational skills to help with those bigger jobs later. For example, if your dream job is to be a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/software-engineering-internships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">software engineer<\/a>, then consider being a coding tutor or having an entry-level IT job at school. Or, perhaps you\u2019re a journalism major trying to use your skills in marketing; why not try both and see where you\u2019re more inclined?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don\u2019t have it all mapped out (which is valid and more common than you may think), then taking an administrative or customer-service-oriented job is a great way to build soft skills while you decide!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Five great general entry-level jobs:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/customer-service-representative-jobs\/\">Customer Service Representative<\/a><\/li><li>Administrative Assistant<\/li><li>Social Media Assistant<\/li><li>Student IT Technician<\/li><li>Research Assistant<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>How much do entry-level jobs get paid?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The pay of entry level jobs depends on what the role is, where you live, and if you\u2019re full-time or part-time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has broken wages down by state <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/oes\/current\/oessrcst.htm\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a> for your specific role\u2019s salary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I find an entry-level job?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Four ways to find an entry-level job:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Handshake<\/strong>: search your area for \u201centry-level jobs near me\u201d using Handshake\u2019s easy job filtering feature<\/li><li><strong>Your university<\/strong>: browse your school\u2019s job listing page or ask your professors if they know of any openings for TAs or research assistants<\/li><li><strong>Personal network<\/strong>: reach out to classmates, friends, or upperclassmen in other majors and see if they have any advice or connections<\/li><li><strong>Your Handshake network<\/strong>: search on Handshake for <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/3-ways-other-students-on-handshake-can-help-you\/\">other students and alumni who have had jobs that you\u2019re interested in<\/a> who can answer your questions about their job, how they liked it, and how to go about applying to something similar<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>What should I look for in an entry-level job?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you apply to your entry-level job consider the following questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can you work there part-time or full-time?<\/li><li>What industry skills do you want to learn more about?<\/li><li>Do you want your job to be remote or not?<\/li><li>Does the company\u2019s values align with your own?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What experience do I need for an entry-level job?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of entry-level jobs will not require a long list of previous experience. Most just want to know that you are conscious about how to translate your skills and characteristics to their position and that you&#8217;re passionate about whatever they\u2019re about.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, occasionally you might come across an \u201centry-level\u201d job listing that asks for applicants to have more specific training. So, why do some entry level jobs require experience? In this case, it would be easy to continue scrolling along and be discouraged at the things that you don\u2019t think you have. But if the role is something that you just can\u2019t get out of your head, then use the experience you have from school, internships, or volunteering to get your foot in the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What should I put on my resume?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many places hiring entry-level employees are looking for similar keywords in <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-new-grad-resume-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resumes<\/a>, but what makes the right candidate is listing the skills that make you stand out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>List your past experiences&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve never had a job in your field before, you definitely have skills from past experiences you can offer.
