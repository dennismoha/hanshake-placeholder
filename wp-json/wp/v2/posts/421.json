Congratulations! You may have spent hours <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/looking-for-a-summer-job-near-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"searching for available positions (opens in a new tab)\">searching for available positions<\/a> \u2014 and applying to each one \u2014 but in the end it was worth it to get that call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe you\u2019re here because you\u2019re interested in preparing for the <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/5-ways-college-students-are-landing-internships-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">internship search process<\/a>. Congrats are still in order for starting your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/career-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">career development<\/a> early!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever you are in the process, you\u2019ll need to prepare for that interview. Doing this early can help you learn what\u2019s expected from the professionals who will eventually interview you. And when they do, you should prepare with these example questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell me about yourself<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is still one of the most common, and most difficult to answer, questions. There are many places to start, but here is how you can stand out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell them about your career goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When an employer asks about you, they want to know how your interests and experience relate to the internship you\u2019re interviewing for. You can start off with a short narrative about your background and quickly transition into <strong>relevant experience<\/strong>. For example, if you\u2019re interviewing for a finance role and previously shadowed a financial advisor, you want to focus on that experience. Make sure to also mention how your&nbsp; experience ties into the needs listed in the job description.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why do you want to work for this company?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s helpful to do some research and make sure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1rfchGlt_ygz_3bpFp8Zf23WMdg9MVAaNos5aP3zbAtI\">skills, interests, and values<\/a> are aligned with the company even before you apply. It makes this question much easier to answer if, for example, a company\u2019s mission to \u201creduce their carbon footprint on the environment\u201d is important to you too. Your interviewer will be happy to know that you share their mission and values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you expecting from this internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An internship is a great segue into your professional career and a valuable learning experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead of referring to the internship as \u201cstepping stone\u201d to your career, your answer should reflect a desire to learn the trade and practice your soft skills over the short and long term. The interviewer will remember this answer when they\u2019re considering candidates for full-time positions next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The behavioral question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every interview will have at least one unanticipated question, and it\u2019s usually the behavioral question. This question focuses on how you have dealt with certain situations, customers, deadlines, management styles\u2026 There really is no limit on how creative employers can be with these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to take some time to think of a few examples ahead of time, so you can be prepared for this question.&nbsp;<br>Remember to choose an answer that is <strong>relevant to your work experience<\/strong>. Tell them how you completed a difficult project, eased a distressed peer while volunteering, or about your last accomplishment when working with a supportive supervisor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A guide to answering four of the most challenging interview
