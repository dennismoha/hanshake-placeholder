This includes people like Sarah Thomas, the first-ever full-time female official in NFL history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were lucky enough to sit down with Sarah for our Ask Me Anything event to learn more about her journey from childhood to career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah\u2019s unique story is an inspiring and timely reminder that remarkable leaders have often veered away from traditional career paths. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reflection of Handshake\u2019s mission of democratizing access to jobs for students, regardless of gender, race, or socioeconomic status, we were excited to learn how Sarah is leveling the playing field for young women wanting to pursue a career in the NFL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is Sarah Thomas?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.profootballnetwork.com\/sarah-thomas-nfl-female-official\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sarah Thomas<\/a> is a woman of firsts.

Sarah\u2019s parents and brothers were athletes, so sports had always been central to her life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lettered five times in softball in high school and received a basketball scholarship to the University of Mobile. After graduating, she joined a men\u2019s basketball league to continue her passion for sports. Sarah played pick-up games with her brothers growing up, so being the only girl on the court was nothing new. However, she was voted out of the men\u2019s league after three years for precisely this reason. Men were uncomfortable playing with her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their discomfort wasn\u2019t going to stop Thomas from participating in sports one way or another. Her brother told her about an aspiring football officials meeting and she tagged along. When she walked into the meeting, she was unaware that women had never officiated or that this wasn\u2019t \u201ctheir job.\u201d But everyone was honest with her about expectations and it was this openness that changed Thomas\u2019 life forever. She knew she <em>had<\/em> to be a part of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for breaking barriers, well, that began at a young age. When she was in fifth grade, Thomas\u2019 aunt asked her if she was going to play basketball, but Thomas explained that there wasn\u2019t a girl\u2019s team. Her aunt responded with, \u201cGo out for the boy&#8217;s team,\u201d so she did. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/sarah-thomas-nfl-super-bowl-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This began her trailblazing journey.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From &#8216;<em>you\u2019ve never played football?<\/em>&#8216; to making NFL history<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being the first full-time female official in the NFL, Sarah Thomas has yet to play a game of football. But she didn\u2019t let that stop her from making history along the way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a female athlete, Sarah was used to women\u2019s sports where women refs were quite common. She didn\u2019t realize how unusual it was for a woman to break into the world of male sports as an official, which could be why she so fearlessly pursued her passion. Sarah started with grade school football before progressing to high school games.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas worked hard and earned a reputation as being one of the best. After officiating a high school state championship game, she grabbed the attention of Gerry Austin, a now-retired NFL ref who officiated for nearly 30 years. He hired her onto the Conference USA staff. That was the beginning of Thomas\u2019 impressive roster of \u201cfirsts.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas went on to officiate a major college game before earning a full college game schedule (11 games). Her \u201cBe a learn it all, not a know it all\u201d attitude allowed Sarah to hone her skills and land the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl crew assignment. With a growing list of achievements, Thomas was hired to the United Football League as part of the crew for the 2010 Championship Game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean Payton, head coach for the New Orleans Saints, endorsed Thomas for the NFL appointment in 2015 after she officiated their training camp practices and the pro game. He told ESPN that \u201cShe\u2019s gonna do well. We\u2019ve watched her grow, and she\u2019s gonna be outstanding. She\u2019s got the right demeanor; she\u2019s sharp.\u201d Shortly after, she made history yet again as the first full-time female official in the NFL and just a few years later, she officiated Super Bowl LV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sarah Thomas\u2019 hard-hitting impact<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah\u2019 story has inspired women everywhere and given aspiring professionals the hope that we can make our dreams a reality someday, but she has done so much more than that too. Sarah opened doors for other women like Katie Sowers and Jennifer King (both female leaders who work(ed) in the NFL), and she has fundamentally changed the NFL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/nfl\/2021\/02\/07\/five-things-know-sarah-thomas-first-woman-official-super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In 2017, Thomas was promoted from line judge to down judge<\/a>. Previously known as \u201chead linesman,\u201d down judge was a term the NFL initiated after Sarah joined the NFL to be more gender-neutral. The NFL wanted Thomas to know that they acknowledge her and encourage more women to join as officials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Handshake, Thomas has gone on her journey in hopes that other women (and underrepresented groups) can get into careers they truly love. She wants female officials in <em>every<\/em> sport, but for now, she\u2019s happy the NFL just hired another female official.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-6-edited.png?resize=837%2C469&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8952\" width=\"837\" height=\"469\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption>Sarah Thomas is the first woman to officiate a Super Bowl game.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Sarah wants you to know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking outside of her fame as the first full-time female official in the NFL, Thomas reflected on her journey and gave leaders and job-seekers alike some great advice. First and foremost, do what you truly love. And do it because you love it, not because you\u2019re trying to live up to someone\u2019s expectations or because you\u2019re seeking recognition\u2014just do it because you love it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah told us to stop comparing our journey to others. This can be hard, but she summed up the perfect reason to: \u201cComparison is the thief of all joy.\u201d Whether you\u2019re breaking barriers or landing your dream job in an industry already suited to you, don\u2019t compare yourself to what other people are doing. Prove to <em>yourself<\/em> that you belong there and that you can do the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA leader has the people. A boss has a title,\u201d which is why it\u2019s crucial that leadership is hands-on from the beginning. Upper management can sponsor ERGs and spearhead diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to show new hires that they truly value diversity and people from all backgrounds. Thomas encourages managers to be leaders, not bosses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For future generations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard not to be moved by Thomas\u2019 journey to the NFL. She is a pioneer who started out not wanting to give up sports to become the first-ever full-time female official in the NFL. She has been a catalyst for change in the league, and it all began because she didn\u2019t let society\u2019s expectations hold her back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Thomas has leveled the playing field for women hoping to officiate in the NFL, but more broadly for anyone who enters into a career that doesn\u2019t have a lot of people who look or sound like them. If Thomas has taught us anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t let a lack of diversity discourage you from dreaming.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We sat down with Sarah Thomas
