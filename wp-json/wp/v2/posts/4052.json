You\u2019re on your way to finding a great job or internship. To help you get started, we\u2019ve outlined five steps to take during your first five days on Handshake. Read below for tips that will put you on track to landing your next opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Day 1: Fill out your profile&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t skip the most important step of getting started on Handshake\u2014completing your profile. This is absolutely necessary to have success in finding a job or internship. The information in your profile helps you receive the most relevant job recommendations, and helps employers find you in their candidate searches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to fill in <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-3-must-haves-on-your-handshake-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your job interests<\/a> including job type, cities, and roles that you want to explore. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not quite sure what you want to do or where you want to be, you can update your profile at any time. Next, add your work experience, courses, organizations and skills. The more information you include in your profile, the better your chances are of hearing from recruiters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6><em>Upload your <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/the-new-grad-resume-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resume<\/a> so you\u2019ll be ready to apply to jobs. If you\u2019re applying for more than one type of role, consider modifying your resume for each one and uploading different versions.<\/em><\/h6>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Day 2: Explore jobs and save the ones you like<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve filled out your profile, you\u2019ll receive personalized job recommendations based on this information. And as you add interests and update your profile, your recommendations will update as well\u2014helping you <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-the-jobs-you-want-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">find the right jobs for you<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you\u2019re viewing your recommended jobs on Handshake, save the ones that catch your eye. This will store them on your dashboard and in the Saved tab on the job search page\u2014helping you quickly find them when you\u2019re ready to apply. You\u2019ll receive important notifications about saved jobs, including reminders to apply before the deadline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving jobs also shows Handshake what you&#8217;re looking for, so your job recommendations become even more relevant. To save a job, click the bookmark icon located on the right side of the job preview or on the left hand side of the job page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Day 3: See who\u2019s hiring and follow employers&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The employers you see on Handshake want to hire students at your school. And with top employers in every field, you\u2019ll be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/how-to-find-great-companies-to-work-for-on-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">find organizations you want to work for<\/a>. When you see an employer you like, be sure to follow them by clicking the Follow button on their page\u2014or the star button if you\u2019re on the app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll receive alerts when the employers you follow post new jobs and events on Handshake. Plus,  following employers helps improve your job recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Day 4: Register for a virtual recruiting event&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/students\/virtual-career-fairs-are-here-next-stop-getting-hired\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual recruiting events<\/a> are taking center stage this year, giving you an opportunity to meet employers through your device. Employers will be hosting sessions with students at your school to recruit for open jobs and internships. This is also a good reason to follow employers you\u2019re interested in\u2014because you\u2019ll be notified when they\u2019re attending virtual fairs on Handshake. Also be sure to check your email and log in often to see upcoming events for students at your school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual fairs on Handshake are unlike the traditional career fair you may be familiar with. When you register for a virtual fair, you\u2019re able to sign up early for sessions with the employers you want to meet.
