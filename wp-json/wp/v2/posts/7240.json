These questions are asked to measure your self awareness as much as seeing if you\u2019re qualified for the job. Here are some tips for crafting your answers and impressing your interviewer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Talking about your strengths<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To prepare for this question, go back and review the job posting. Then create a short list of your strengths and skills as they relate to the qualifications and responsibilities listed for the role. This list can include hard or technical skills and soft skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, review the list and think about what you really excel in. Narrow down the list to what you believe are your two or three strongest qualities. It\u2019s also important to consider which qualities you\u2019d be able to discuss in more detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next to each strength, write supporting information that will help you discuss them. The interviewer will expect you to elaborate on your answers, so think of specific instances when you\u2019ve demonstrated these qualities or had to use these skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, think about how each strength will help you in the role. Remember, interviews are all about convincing the employer that you\u2019re the right person for the job. So, a great answer to this question ultimately ties back to how you\u2019ll bring these strengths to the role and company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Talking about your weaknesses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to approach this question is by not avoiding it. \u201dI can\u2019t think of anything\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t have any\u201d \u2014or the sneaky \u201cI work too hard\u201d\u2014is not an answer you should give.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best approach is to be honest, but mention something that isn\u2019t<em> <\/em>needed for success in the role. This means your answer shouldn\u2019t be something that could affect your job performance. For instance, if you\u2019re interviewing for an accounting role, you don\u2019t want to tell the interviewer that you\u2019re unorganized or bad with details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, think of something that doesn\u2019t come naturally to you, but is something you\u2019re working on. Then, frame your answer in a way that illustrates how you\u2019re trying to overcome or have improved this weakness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve struggled with public speaking, you could mention that you\u2019ve started volunteering more to present group projects or signed up for a debate course. Whatever it is, talking about the actions you&#8217;ve taken will show the interviewer that you\u2019re committed to self improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more tips for answering <a
