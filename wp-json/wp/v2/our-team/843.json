Although there have been some big changes, one thing that won&#8217;t change is our set of core values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m so proud of the team and the culture we are building at Handshake. As the company continues to grow, we are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that is inclusive and supportive\u2014and empowers our employees to thrive professionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We display our company values throughout the office so we can reference them when making important decisions. Every week we celebrate individuals in the company that are living out these values. These values are not just words on the wall; they are fundamental to the work we do every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Handshake company values<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Students First<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission is to democratize access to opportunity and ensure any student can build a great career no matter who they know, where they live or what school they attend. We empathize deeply with our students to increase career opportunities for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Focus on Impact<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stay humble and work hard to democratize opportunity for all students. We like to have fun\u2014and we do\u2014but we\u2019re always focused on how we can best make an impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Move Quickly, But Don\u2019t Rush<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe speed wins, and our operational pace is incredibly fast. Moving quickly while staying aligned requires strategic thought, collaboration, and frequent communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Learn. Grow. Repeat.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We embrace a growth mindset, enabling our team to face obstacles with a tenacious desire to turn challenges into opportunities for growth. We are relentlessly curious, working to close the gap between what we currently know and what we need to know to be as effective as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Act with Empathy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We listen closely to understand our users and clients, approach challenges with curiosity, and treat our colleagues and clients with compassion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Empowered by Diversity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are building an inclusive and diverse community\u2014both on the Handshake platform and across our team.
