Through mentorship, training, and one-on-one coaching, our team is dedicated to each Sales Development Representative\u2019s (SDRs) growth. One way we do this is by making sure that SDRs aren\u2019t spending all of their time just cold calling and appointment setting. They\u2019re actively learning and making an impact while working toward becoming Account Executives (AEs).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our team continues to grow, we\u2019re hiring SDRs to support our stellar team of Enterprise AEs, like Anthony Gilmore, who works with some of our biggest accounts and top companies. \u201cHandshake\u2019s commitment to students attracts people who build an open, curious, and caring culture,\u201d says Anthony. \u201cWhether you have previous SDR experience and want to quickly get to the AE level or are looking for a start in tech\u2014I would encourage you to apply to Handshake. We have the opportunity to work with the best companies in the world, and mentors who truly care about you.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meet three Employer Partnership team members who are sharing their perspectives of what it takes to be a successful SDR at Handshake.

Handshake was particularly interesting to me because it\u2019s at a rapidly growing startup, so there&#8217;s a great balance between having structure and the ability to be creative and implement new ideas. And it\u2019s such a mission-driven organization. I really like the ability to interact with some of the biggest brands while also making a difference in students\u2019 lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite part of the Sales Development Program?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite part is the people. Not only is it a well-thought-out program with numerous opportunities for growth, but everyone is invested in your success and career progression. Since the team is still fairly small, there is always opportunity to innovate and help shape how the program evolves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why would you encourage people to join Handshake as an SDR?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would encourage people to join because of the immense opportunities to learn and grow in your career. You are exposed to and get ownership of so much in this role. If you put in the work, you\u2019re able to move as quickly as you want. The Employer Team, in particular, is expanding rapidly, which means you\u2019ll be joining at an exciting time during the company\u2019s growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Janessa Pinon<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?fit=890%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-739\" width=\"462\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?w=3008&amp;ssl=1 3008w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=261%2C300&amp;ssl=1 261w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=768%2C884&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=890%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 890w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=640%2C736&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1178&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C1381&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?resize=1920%2C2209&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1651-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes Handshake\u2019s SDR program different from other tech companies?<\/strong><br>As an SDR, you develop real sales skills because the qualification of each account is a big deal. It\u2019s not the typical cold calling and setting up a meeting for an AE, and then moving on. SDRs at Handshake have to think strategically and conduct a thorough qualification call before it moves on to an AE. It really sets you up for the next stage in your sales career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes a successful SDR at Handshake?<\/strong><br>You have to think creatively and work hard. Every effort of outreach counts tremendously in order to keep up with the Employer side of our business. My number one piece of advice is to always ask questions. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask anyone on the team\u2014they\u2019re here to help you get better and continuously grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Christian Rhodes<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?fit=910%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Christian Rhodes\" class=\"wp-image-743\" width=\"455\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?w=2991&amp;ssl=1 2991w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=267%2C300&amp;ssl=1 267w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=768%2C864&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=910%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 910w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=640%2C720&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=1024%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=1200%2C1350&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?resize=1920%2C2159&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_1668.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite thing about the Sales Development Program at Handshake?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SDR team at Handshake is amazing\u2014everyone is so hungry to learn and grow.
