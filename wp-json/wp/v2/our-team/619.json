In addition, this round includes participation from leading social impact investors such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chanzuckerberg.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;(CZI),&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.omidyar.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Omidyar Network<\/strong><\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/reachcapital.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Reach Capital<\/strong><\/a>, among others. Students around the world experience the same inequality in the recruiting process, so we\u2019re also excited to leverage the expertise of EQT and our impact investors to both deepen our work in the United States and look for ways to support students globally as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, our Handshake community has grown\u200a\u2014\u200aa lot! I\u2019m proud to share that our Handshake community now includes&nbsp;<strong>700 colleges and universities, 14 million students and young alumni, and 300,000 employers\u200a\u2014\u200a<\/strong>including 100% of the Fortune 500. And today, the Handshake community proudly supports more than 100+ minority-serving institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions across the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/2000\/1*5L3D2-OB-279Lpr5xREsbw.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"null\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>One Team, One&nbsp;Mission<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of today\u2019s announcement, please join me in welcoming a few new partners to Team Handshake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Alastair Mitchell<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>of EQT Ventures has joined our Board of Directors!<\/strong>&nbsp;Alastair (Ali) and the EQT Ventures team add deep expertise when it comes to advising, building and scaling global data-driven consumer success stories such as Spotify, King and Booking.com and B2B SaaS companies such as Huddle. Ali\u2019s energy, passion and deep understanding of growing SaaS go-to-market have already made a tremendous impact on the company.

Each of their teams brings a wide range of personal and professional experience successfully working through the myriad challenges of driving positive social impact&nbsp;<strong>at scale<\/strong>. To best leverage their collective expertise, we\u2019re forming the first Handshake Impact Advisory Board, which will help measure Handshake\u2019s impact on students from all backgrounds, advise us on how we can more effectively achieve our mission, and identify the people, organizations and networks who can accelerate our impact.<\/li><li><strong>Christine Y.

We\u2019ve had big wins and small wins\u200a\u2014\u200aplus lots of learnings in between. As a founder, I\u2019m equally proud of all these moments and wanted to share a few recent highlights and a preview of what\u2019s coming next!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Students<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Back-to-School season, we launched&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/democratizing-information-reviews-and-q-and-a-on-handshake\/\">Reviews and Q&amp;A<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;on Handshake. Our goal: Break down the barriers to information that far too many students face in their job search\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially first-generation college students.&nbsp;<strong>Reviews<\/strong>&nbsp;allow students to learn from the job and internship experiences of other students across the Handshake community. With<strong>&nbsp;Q&amp;A<\/strong>, we\u2019re creating an engaging community for students to ask questions and get career advice from alumni and students across Handshake with relevant experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/2000\/1*VdpmN5WoknF-ezYlE-oVKg.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"null\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In just three months, we\u2019ve received nearly 100,000 Reviews and more than 53% of students have engaged with Q&amp;A, highlighting the pent-up student demand to learn from the real-life experiences of other students and alumni. In the next few years, we\u2019re going to continue working to democratize career information for all students by building a deeper and more engaging community of students, alumni, employers, faculty and career centers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Series C investment will also fund a significant growth in our data and recommendations teams, who will help us better leverage all of the data we see today\u200a\u2014\u200afrom first-year students\u2019 career interests to post-graduate career outcomes\u200a\u2014\u200ato help provide more relevant and contextual advice and recommendations to students throughout their career journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Universities<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As our university community grows, we continue to see two consistent trends on campuses:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/career-centers\/students-meet-opportunity-how-handshake-elevates-your-university-brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"><strong>Increased opportunity and increased student engagement.<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;This year, the average school switching to Handshake saw a 3x increase in opportunities within the first 3 months of our partnership. This means more employers coming to campus and posting jobs and internships for students. As a result, universities are seeing a 60% increase in the number of students engaging with the career center. The more students engage with career education, the better prepared they will be to launch their career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1200\/1*CO88LO-MXdUwduTW15eidg.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"null\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Going forward, Handshake will be working with our university partners to elevate career education earlier in a student\u2019s time on campus, by engaging faculty and other campus partners more deeply in the career journey and by making it easier for students to link academic and extra-curricular experiences with career outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Employers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the fall recruiting season, we launched the&nbsp;<strong>Talent Engagement Suite<\/strong>&nbsp;for employers to effectively engage students and young alumni throughout their full college to career journey. The days of building your recruiting strategy by hoping the right student walks up to your career fair booth are over. Students are researching opportunities continuously throughout the year, and look for a constant stream of information and engagement. Now, it\u2019s about building more diverse, qualified candidate pools, deepening relationships with students ahead of campus or virtual events and leveraging data and benchmarks to make better recruiting decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/2000\/1*k72wRH7i4Ij_dRlRQjx2DQ.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"null\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our new Premium suite of features enables recruiting teams to connect with campuses across Handshake\u2019s 700+ university community and effectively engage students and alumni throughout their full college to career journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our Premium employer partners, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/democratizeopportunity.com\/how-ibm-is-democratizing-information-for-students-across-the-country-bed18d16f006\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>IBM<\/strong><\/a><strong>,&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/democratizeopportunity.com\/how-box-redesigned-their-hiring-process-to-build-a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-workforce-166c49614b2b\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Box<\/strong><\/a><strong>, and&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/democratizeopportunity.com\/m-t-bank-optimizes-on-campus-visits-with-proactive-outreach-on-handshake-e995ef421fb3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>M&amp;T Bank<\/strong><\/a>, are leveraging dynamic segments and smart campaigns to proactively engage students and young alumni.
