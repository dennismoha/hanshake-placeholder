My father was a navy diver for 30 years. From the time we got our first Atari until Nintendo 64, my brother destroyed me in every game we owned. So I literally stopped and never played video games again (it\u2019s ok, we\u2019re best friends now, haha). I picked up basketball and became pretty good at it (much better than my brother).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While my father was away at college preparing for his transition out of the navy, I moved to VA to live with my mother. There I focused more on basketball and got my grades up a bit. I went to Florida State as a Pre-Law student, but that didn\u2019t last long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1932\" height=\"2576\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?w=1932&amp;ssl=1 1932w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=640%2C853&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=1024%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_KePiRsvRDkOLgsxIQyXBYw.jpg?resize=1920%2C2560&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"75c7\"><strong>How did you get started in software?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My father was trying to start a minority business incubator around 2000.

They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re working hard to add to their skills, but they don\u2019t match the pattern we\u2019ve been trained to match against. As I\u2019ve been architecting the Handshake app, I\u2019ve been focused on levels of abstraction. I\u2019m trying to build things in such a way as to allow for easy exploration of the code base as well as provide a way for junior engineers to jump in and contribute right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"98a3\"><strong>Please state 2\u20133 of your current career goals. Why are these important to you?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My three goals for this year were to ship several major features in our app (done), become a lead or engineering manager at Handshake (done), and ship one of my side projects (almost done). I have pretty specific medium and long term goals that all support my primary goal of providing for my kids\u2019 education. My plan also includes giving them access to travel, resources, and programs that will give them an advantage in the world so they can continue to make a positive impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"7d5c\"><strong>Give an example of a recent time you\u2019ve helped a fellow engineer. What lessons can be taken from their situation?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-581\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=1440%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/1_XiK5U6loXDFJ8vnGF6ZG2w.jpg?resize=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently I met an engineer who was actively looking for a new role. They didn\u2019t have the pedigree that others have and that companies in the Bay still look for. I explained some of the ways I used actual projects and online content in place of a prestigious degree to help show my value to prospective companies. I\u2019m learning more about what companies are looking for and how career switchers and boot camp grads can stand out and get noticed. Our biases toward brand-name schools is deep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"796a\"><strong>In what areas can \/dev\/color members reach out to you for help?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a lead engineer, people manager, public speaker, and a father of two kids \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve worked at small, medium, and large companies. I\u2019d be honored to answer questions or share any stories that might help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"ca9a\"><strong>As a member of \/dev\/color you are also committed to developing yourself. Can you share some areas you are looking to improve?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m looking for opportunities to grow as a leader. I\u2019m looking for more guidance around building teams, guiding careers, public speaking, and supporting large architectures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"ac74\"><strong>Can you speak about any passions outside of programming?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m probably most passionate about effective communication and conversation. Most people either are afraid to have candid, respectful conversations or don\u2019t know how. When two people with opposing views are able to exchange ideas, they both learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"d731\"><strong>Why is being a part of an organization like \/dev\/color important to you?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\/dev\/color has connected me with black engineers who are at the top of their field. Over the course of my career, I\u2019ve never been able to say that I had a mentor until now. Additionally, so many of us in \/dev\/color are doing work in the community. Being able to tap into that energy has been amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"fe14\"><strong>Anything else you\u2019d like to say\/express?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times black engineers shy away from being the \u201conly\u201d at a company, or after a while of being the \u201conly\u201d, they leave. I totally understand this, especially if the company culture is the culprit. Still, I\u2019d encourage more of us to stay and stick it out. While you\u2019re there, some other black engineer might also come along and may be more likely to apply and stay. Then we all win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that by doing this eventually things will even out. It\u2019ll take a while, because we\u2019re still making up ground, but I hope to see true evidence of this in my lifetime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn about
