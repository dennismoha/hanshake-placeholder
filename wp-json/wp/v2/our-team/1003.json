On the day I quit my previous job, I was shocked when I got a call from someone offering me a dream project \u2014 a chance to build a software solution. Without hesitation, I said yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But things don\u2019t always turned out as planned. After four months of work, the customer told me they had lost funding and weren\u2019t going to be able to pay me. I was devastated. I had burned through my savings and had no way to capitalize on my work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing my first and only customer, I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to join a software company and learn what it takes to sell the software I wanted to build.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I applied to work at Handshake, it was an unknown, thirty-person company. But I recognized the incredible potential of the mission, and I knew this was where I would grow the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My plan wasn\u2019t to stay long. I told myself that in a year, I could leave with great experience and enough money to finish building my software project. But, as I\u2019ve said, things don\u2019t always go as planned. In January, I will be celebrating three and a half years at Handshake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why have I stayed? The two main reasons are empathy and a culture of impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/\/srv\/htdocs\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sales team in NYC\" class=\"wp-image-1054\" width=\"571\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Empathy is the feeling of being understood and guided<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigating your career, whether you are a mid-career professional or a college student, isn\u2019t easy. The leadership at Handshake has always been there to guide me and help me grow, persevere, and feel understood. The fact that the product itself is that same trusted guide for millions of students from all backgrounds, is remarkable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>A culture of impact requires big thinking<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been on two sales teams at Handshake, both of which have always set large goals to make the most impact. As a member of our university sales team, I saw our university partnerships grow from 160 to 700 in under two years \u2014 and we continue to grow! Every school on Handshake means more access to opportunity and more information for students to navigate their college to career journey. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a member of our <a href=\"https:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/blog\/our-team\/whats-it-like-to-work-at-handshake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"employer sales team (opens in a new tab)\">employer sales team<\/a>, I\u2019ve seen our team grow from three people to fifty in just two years. We\u2019ve consistently exceeded our sales goals, and have experienced remarkable growth during my time here. We get to work with some of the most recognized companies in the world, and every employer we partner with equals more opportunities for students on Handshake and more diversity in the workplace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These past three and a half years have been some of the most memorable of my life. I\u2019ve made amazing friends, and have grown both professionally and personally. It&#8217;s also been much more lucrative than building my own software program! I\u2019m so grateful for my time at Handshake, and I can\u2019t wait to see what the next three years hold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn more about sales at Handshake?
