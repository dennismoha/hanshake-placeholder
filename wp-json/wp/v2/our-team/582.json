The past two summers I interned at two different corporate companies and had positive experiences. However, throughout both I felt limited in what I could contribute and my actual impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"f6c2\">The Opportunity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this past summer I was offered a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mtu.edu\/career\/students\/jobs\/co-ops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-op<\/a>&nbsp;for a semester in Silicon Valley and the opportunity to experience the startup life at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/joinhandshake.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handshake<\/a>. This is something I\u2019ve been very interested in the past few years but never had the opportunity to experience. Here was my opportunity to verify that this is, in fact, what I wanted to do and something that I would enjoy. I only had a few weeks before Fall Semester started and I already had all of my classes scheduled, a house rented and everything planned. It was a difficult decision weighing between going back to school full-time or taking a semester off and doing a co-op. I realized this was a unique opportunity and I could easily pick up school where I left off. This was a one-of-a-kind experience, and I couldn\u2019t pass it up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fa9e\">The First Week<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours after I was on the ground in Palo Alto I already had my first project and was investigating how to approach it. There wasn\u2019t an elaborate orientation like my previous internships. On the contrary, it was an immediate \u201cdig in and get dirty.\u201d I liked it. Within a few&nbsp;<strong>days<\/strong>&nbsp;I had my first&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/help.github.com\/articles\/using-pull-requests\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pull Request<\/a>&nbsp;open, merged and pushed to production for the main app. The projects I worked on for&nbsp;<strong>months&nbsp;<\/strong>in my earlier internships never saw the light of production. The culture and atmosphere were drastically different from what I also previously experienced. It was over a dozen people eating, sleeping, and working under the same roof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"c839\">Projects<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had the ability to work on a large variety of projects ranging from one-off customer integrations to quality assurance to recruiting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"c61b\">Handshake Specs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This started as a simple script I used locally to find flakey tests that were running on&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/circleci.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">CircleCI<\/a>&nbsp;in an attempt to cut down on flake that was in the test suite. I discussed it with&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/u\/da94bc7898ff?source=post_page-----9d1072262251----------------------\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Ringwelski<\/a>&nbsp;and he suggested ways to improve upon it and create an internal tool to assist all of the Engineers in cutting down on the number of flakey tests. It was an exciting project for me because it was my first full&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/rubyonrails.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rails<\/a>&nbsp;app and I got to experiment with new technologies. I decided to try out&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/\" target=\"_blank\">React<\/a>&nbsp;and had a positive experience. In addition to analyzing the tests in the UI, when a test failed (and still hasn\u2019t passed) it will send a notification to a&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack<\/a>&nbsp;channel until it gets resolved. \u201cHandshake Specs\u201d is now used by the team for several internal repositories that have test suites running on CircleCI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What I learned: Rails (and many gems), React, CircleCI API, Slack API<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a94f\">Quality Assurance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever an application continues to grow with multiple hands working on it and a user base in the thousands, quality is a big concern. I was assigned the task of quality assurance and related tasks. This includes validating new features and bug fixes before they get deployed, as well as reproducing bug reports and determining the cause so it can be moved into the development pipeline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reproducing bugs has been one of the most rewarding and frustrating tasks I\u2019ve worked on. They are often very obscure and only occur in a specific scenario. I use almost every internal tool to get to the bottom of some of the more difficult bugs. I try to reproduce the bug on the Handshake Staging app by searching&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/bugsnag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bugsnag<\/a>&nbsp;logs, browsing the audit logs, watching&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fullstory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fullstory<\/a>&nbsp;if I\u2019m lucky, open the corresponding code, accessing the staging console to directly manipulate data to setup the scenario and discussing it with Engineers. Many times the answer isn\u2019t obvious using just one of these methods but rather a combination to stitch together the specific scenario created by the user and finding a way to make it reproducible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What I learned: Critical Thinking, Debugging<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6067\">Marketing Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The website that was live a few months ago was a WordPress template with outdated content and poor call-to-actions. The product and design team mocked-up a full new marketing website. I was tasked with taking the designs and creating the website. I was given very few specifications other than the mocks so I got to decide what to do for much of it. Since the website was completely static I decided to go with&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/jekyllrb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jekyll<\/a>&nbsp;after doing an earlier implementation in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">React<\/a>. This offered the flexibility to dynamically generate the website but still host it nearly anywhere. It was even hosted using&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub Pages<\/a>&nbsp;for a while (but they unfortunately don\u2019t fully support SSL). This was by far the largest website I\u2019ve worked on from start to finish with several hundred visitors per day. I am currently still making changes on a daily basis tweaking content, adding blog posts or adding pages for different teams. Additionally, I\u2019ve started exploring basic SEO to help improve the ranking, how the website is displayed when shared on Facebook and basic Ad Retargeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What I learned: Jekyll, Basic SEO, Ad Retargeting, Open Graph<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"c834\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding to take a semester off of school and experience what it\u2019s like to work at a startup, specifically Handshake, was one of the best decisions I have made. I\u2019ve learned a large variety of new technologies (Rails, Jekyll, React) in addition to growing personal skills (critical thinking, problem solving, and balancing projects). Over the past few months the amount I\u2019ve learned drastically exceeds what I would have learned in the classroom. I would highly recommend this same experience to anyone interested in startups and technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"9a1b\">After all, I\u2019ve had so much fun I\u2019m staying for another semester.<\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spencer Miskoviak, an engineer at Handshake, discusses why he made the decision \u2014 just a few weeks before the beginning of fall
