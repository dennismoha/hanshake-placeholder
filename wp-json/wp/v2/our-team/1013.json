Not only do SDRs add value to the sales cycle, but they bring a fantastic energy to the sales floor. I really enjoy managing such a dynamic and engaged team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had the opportunity to learn from incredible leaders, and it\u2019s important to me to be a good example and positive mentor to each SDR on the team. I spend a lot of time getting to know SDRs to learn what motivates, inspires, and challenges them \u2014 so I can personalize my management style for each. I make sure to provide feedback and coaching that\u2019s relevant to their current role as well as their career goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Managing with empathy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-06-at-5.17.43-PM-2678909052-1573595258860.png?resize=221%2C260&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1053\" width=\"221\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-06-at-5.17.43-PM-2678909052-1573595258860.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=221%2C260&amp;ssl=1 442w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-06-at-5.17.43-PM-2678909052-1573595258860.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=221%2C260&amp;ssl=1 663w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal management mission statement is \u201cBe empathetic and kind, but push people to be their best.\u201d I have high expectations and I want SDRs to feel challenged \u2014 by me, their teammates, and themselves. I believe strongly that if I invest my time in coaching and developing the careers of SDRs, the results will follow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important parts of management, in my opinion, is building confidence\u2014either by recommending a professional development book, asking team members to list things they\u2019re doing really well, or playing a scene from Beyonce\u2019s <em>Homecoming <\/em>documentary (confidence in its truest form!) I also make sure to recognize accomplishments, and let SDRs know I believe in them by giving them opportunities for more responsibility. Sometimes, people just need a reminder that they are great at their job and deserve to be confident.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is incredibly hard working, but we also take time to get away from our desks and enjoy each other\u2019s company with regular team lunches and Taco Tuesdays \u2014 as well as trips to San Francisco Giants baseball games or the Ghirardelli chocolate shop for sundaes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re hiring SDRs at Handshake!
