This of course includes unit tests, integration tests, and UI testing which one might consider the \u201cnormal\u201d tests for a web application. However, tests and specs are a very powerful tool that can go beyond just \u201cnormal.\u201d Especially as an engineering team grows, writing specs for goals such as enforcing project structure, proper dependency management, and feature toggle clean up become incredibly helpful. Below is a quick outline of some of the additional behaviors we test in our automated test suite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Project-Structure\">Project Structure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bRecently while contributing to the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bbatsov\/rubocop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rubocop<\/a> project, I was pleasantly surprised to run into a test failure in their \u201cproject spec\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bbatsov\/rubocop\/blob\/master\/spec\/project_spec.rb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">file<\/a>. For their use case, the project spec made sure that the default configurations were valid and fully inclusive and also that the CHANGELOG file was properly formatted. Awesome! After quickly fixing the CHANGELOG entry, inspiration hit to add a similar spec to some of our larger services and applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"An-example-project-structure-spec\">An example project structure spec<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bLike Rubocop, we have now added numerous specs to enforce proper project structure. Let\u2019s take a look at an example project structure spec:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"404\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=1024%2C404&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=1024%2C404&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=300%2C118&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=768%2C303&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=1536%2C606&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=2048%2C808&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=640%2C253&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=1200%2C474&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.56.15-PM.png?resize=1920%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we iterate through our models directory and generate an array of relevant classes. In our case, we skip a few that are not relevant to this spec. Next, we iterate through each class and make sure that it inherits from ApplicationRecord. Although ApplicationRecord is a default in Rails 5 with its generators, in Rails 4 the generators generate models which inherit from ActiveRecord::Base rather than ApplicationRecord, so this was easily missed.<br>\u200b<br>Simple as that! Some other examples of project specs are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ensure proper inheritance of ApplicationController, ApplicationMailer, etc.<\/li><li>Ensure that each model has an ActiveModelSerializer serializer<\/li><li>Ensure that each model spec has a unit test file and a factory<\/li><li>Ensure that for each controller a request spec file is defined<\/li><li>Ensure that each resource has a permission spec to test access controls for specific resources<br>\u200b<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Project-structure-specs:-Just-do-them\">Project structure specs: Just do them<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bWithin about an hour, we had an exhaustive spec for ensuring any changes to the project follow the proper structure. One of the biggest win with this addition is for developers who choose not to use the built-in rails generators for adding new features or scaffolds. Previously, some non-critical files may have been forgotten without using generators, which is now not an issue (and engineers get to choose what works best for them!). We expect this change to also be particularly beneficial for on-boarding new engineers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Gemfile\">Gemfile<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bRails has a vast and mature ecosystem, and with that comes bundled solutions to many common problems in the form of a gem. With such a strong emphasis on testing in the ruby and rails community, it is often safe to use gems. However, in some cases we have enforced policies regarding dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Disallowing-gems\">Disallowing gems<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bAlthough rare, in a couple of cases we have decided to explicitly block certain gems from our Gemfile.<br>\u200b<br>One of the gems we block is <em>libxml-ruby<\/em>. After a long and difficult debugging session, we found <em>libxml-ruby<\/em> and <em>nokogiri<\/em> do not play well together and cause seemingly random heap corruption. We removed our dependency on <em>libxml-ruby<\/em> and added the below spec (with verbose comments) to ensure it does not get added back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"92\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=1024%2C92&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=1024%2C92&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=300%2C27&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=768%2C69&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=1536%2C138&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=2048%2C184&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=640%2C57&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=1200%2C108&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joinhandshake.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-1.58.06-PM.png?resize=1920%2C172&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details on the<em> libxml-ruby<\/em> and <em>nokogiri<\/em> issue, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/webuild.envato.com\/blog\/tracking-down-ruby-heap-corruption\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Gem-licenses\">Gem licenses<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bWith the help of the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pivotal\/LicenseFinder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LicenseFinder<\/a> gem, we have a complete and versioned history of our dependency choices. The LicenseFinder gem automatically detects the License for each of your Gemfile dependencies. By running <em>bundle exec license_finder<\/em> the gem can automatically find any gems which have not been approved for usage. To approve a gem, you can either whitelist an entire class of gems (for example, all gems with MIT license) or approve specific gems for usage. Each approval documents who and why the library was approved. By adding this to our CI, we can rest assured all our gems have an acceptable license.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Bundle-audit\">Bundle audit<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bOne way that we keep up to date and informed on ruby gem vulnerabilities is through the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rubysec\/bundler-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bundler-audit<\/a> gem. The bundler-audit gem will review your Gemfile.lock for gem versions w\/ vulnerabilities as well as for insecure gem fetching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Feature-Toggle-Cleanup\">Feature Toggle Cleanup<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bAlong with automated testing and continuous delivery, we are big proponents of feature toggles. Feature toggles allow us to continuously deploy improvements in small, low risk pieces while keeping the change behind a feature toggle until it is ready.<br>\u200b<br>Eventually, many (if not all) of our feature toggles get cleaned up and removed once the feature is finished. In order to make sure that feature toggles do not hang around for too long, we require all feature toggles to be defined with metadata about when the toggle is expected to no longer be needed (among other things such as the toggle name). Then, in a nightly build, we make sure that there are no expired toggles. This has helped us to stay on top of our toggles to ensure they do not linger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bAutomated testing is a crucial and amazing tool for fast moving and correct software. Don\u2019t limit your automated tests to just unit and integration testing\u200a\u2014\u200agive these additional tests and specs a try on your project!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><em>This post was originally published in June 2016 and updated in January 2021.
