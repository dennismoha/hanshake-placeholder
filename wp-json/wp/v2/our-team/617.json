I grew up in a working class family (my dad worked at a paper mill and my mom at an iron foundry) and spent a good chunk of my summers \u201cweeding\u201d in the \u201cgarden\u201d where we grew a lot of the food that my family ate in the fall &amp; winter. I had a paper route starting at 9 years old (the reason most people who knew me in school still insist on calling me by my childhood nickname, \u201cPapes\u201d) and have had some sort of job ever since.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m the youngest of three boys, and I spent my childhood looking up to both of my brothers. They were both into role-playing games, video games, trading card games, and computers, so I was into role-playing games, video games, trading card games, and computers. I spent many, many, many hours listening to Soundgarden on repeat while playing MUD (multi-user dungeon) games over a dial-up modem on the Tandy computer our parents got for us when I was 10 or 11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t become exposed to computer programming until a Visual Basic 6 class during my senior year of high school, and I actually started as an Electrical Engineering major when I went to college. I quickly realized I had zero interest in dealing with the physical engineering world and found a knack for building web applications in this&nbsp;<strong>hot<\/strong>&nbsp;new technology known as Java 2 Enterprise Edition during school. I switched to a Computer Engineering and Business Administration dual-major and worked for a small student-run software consultancy where I got my first professional software development exposure, then moved on to full-time software development roles after school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>My Current Focus<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A large portion of my professional focus now is on growing our University engineering team (which I manage) as a remote-first team that allows Handshake to hire engineering talent from anywhere, no matter their background, family situation, desire for true work-life balance, or geographic mobility. I personally believe that building a better remote culture at Handshake is integral to following through on our promise of truly democratizing opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Interesting Technical Challenges I Face at Handshake<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an engineering manager, I don\u2019t always get to do as much coding as I would like, but I\u2019m still heavily involved in early-stage projects, technical architecture, and scoping. One recent area we\u2019ve begun exploring at Handshake is the potential of taking our products &amp; services outside of the United States, and I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time researching all of the various legal frameworks that govern SaaS companies in the higher education space. Expanding outside of the U.S. has many implications on our long-term technical architecture, data storage strategies, and engineering practices, so it\u2019s been a very interesting problem space to explore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Top Three Career Goals<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Be the kind of person who current and former coworkers think of with fondness.<\/li><li>Work within an authentic environment where everyone gets to be themselves, has their personal goals fostered, and is able to live a full life outside of work.<\/li><li>Achieve financial freedom. I can give you many theories as to why I think this way (involving my childhood, education, rural roots, fatherhood, etc.), but I\u2019m not excited about working as a \u201csalary man\u201d until I\u2019m 70.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Learn. Grow. Repeat.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my consistent struggles is a need for constant validation. Do I matter? Is the work I\u2019m doing impactful? Am I improving the lives of those around me in some way? Most folks have some amount of \u201cimposter syndrome,\u201d and I\u2019m no exception. It\u2019s a struggle and I\u2019m working on ways in which I can feel validated internally without so much of a reliance on validation from others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m also trying to be a better parent. My two children (Katie, 8 and Isaac, 5) are amazing, great, funny, smart kids, but I sometimes feel like an absentee parent. I\u2019m&nbsp;<strong>physically present&nbsp;<\/strong>(especially since I work remotely), and I spend time with my children to do all of the things that are&nbsp;<strong>expected<\/strong>&nbsp;of me, but I want to be better. I want to be the father who plans amazing trips for their kids months in advance and is thoughtful about the things they learn and experience. Right now, it feels like I allow our family life to come at us spontaneously rather than really being thoughtful about how we spend our time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/oWXmnwHmp42HEcOiG0kXIhcCaI1FAF_MfuFuaI8475jpHP1X0lK0iu913kotJnY5Nw9z1XGA5yuyohkMuIqro7WVazlXfj-mVGyQvTi3veMAK6UOsE5QyCGxizy3v3wN4Fh63ES4\" alt=\"null\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another personal goal of mine is qualifying for the Magic: the Gathering Pro Tour (which<a href=\"https:\/\/magic.wizards.com\/en\/competitive-magic\"> got rebranded to \u201cMythic Championships\u201d<\/a>). I play in small, local qualifying tournaments every couple of weeks and have had some success, but I haven\u2019t been able to do well enough at the larger, more competitive tournaments that reward winners with Pro invites. There isn\u2019t a lot of urgency to this goal, but I still play online, practice regularly in-person, and play in tournaments as much as I can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions about joining #TeamHandshake?<\/strong>&nbsp;Feel free to reach out!
